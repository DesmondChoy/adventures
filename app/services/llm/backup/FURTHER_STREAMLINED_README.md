# Further Streamlined Prompts

This document explains the further streamlined prompts that have been implemented to address the remaining redundancies and improve the efficiency of the Learning Odyssey application's LLM prompts.

## Overview

The further streamlined prompts build upon the initial streamlining effort to address additional areas of redundancy and verbosity:

1. **Eliminated Duplicate CRITICAL RULES**: Removed the redundant CRITICAL RULES section from the user prompt
2. **Consolidated Instruction Sections**: Merged related instruction sections for better organization
3. **Streamlined Agency Choice Presentation**: Made agency options more concise and readable
4. **Optimized Phase Guidance**: Created a more focused exposition guidance system
5. **Reduced Verbosity**: Shortened explanations while maintaining essential guidance
6. **Consolidated Format-Related Instructions**: Combined all format instructions into a single section

## Key Improvements

### 1. System Prompt Improvements

- **Consolidated Choice Format Rules**: Added choice formatting guidance to the main CRITICAL RULES section
- **More Concise Rule Descriptions**: Streamlined the wording of rules while preserving meaning
- **Clearer Organization**: Improved the structure for better LLM comprehension

### 2. User Prompt Improvements

- **Chapter Development Guidelines**: Consolidated story chapter instructions and implementation requirements
- **Agency Options**: More concise presentation of agency choices with a clearer format
- **Choice Format Specification**: Simplified format instructions with example choices that provide guidance
- **Removed Redundant CRITICAL RULES**: Eliminated the duplicate rules section from the user prompt

### 3. Agency Category Improvements

- **More Concise Descriptions**: Shortened agency option descriptions while maintaining clarity
- **Consistent Formatting**: Used a "Name - description" format for all options
- **Improved Readability**: Better organization and spacing for easier parsing

### 4. Phase-Specific Guidance

- **Exposition Focus**: Added phase-specific exposition guidance
- **Clearer Instructions**: More direct and actionable guidance for each phase
- **Better Integration**: Seamlessly incorporated into the chapter development guidelines

## Files Added

- `app/services/llm/further_streamlined_prompt_templates.py`: Contains the further streamlined templates
- `app/services/llm/further_streamlined_prompt_engineering.py`: Contains functions to generate prompts using the further streamlined templates
- `app/services/llm/test_further_streamlined.py`: Verifies that the further streamlined prompts are being used correctly
- `app/services/llm/FURTHER_STREAMLINED_README.md`: This file, explaining the further streamlined approach

## Implementation

The further streamlined prompts have been integrated into the application's LLM service:

```python
# For the first chapter, use the further streamlined prompts
if (
    state.current_chapter_number == 1
    and state.planned_chapter_types[0] == ChapterType.STORY
):
    logger.info("Using further streamlined prompts for first chapter")
    system_prompt, user_prompt = build_further_streamlined_prompt(
        state, question, previous_lessons
    )
```

## Before vs. After Comparison

### Original System Prompt CRITICAL RULES

```
# CRITICAL RULES
1. Structure and flow: begin narrative directly (never with "Chapter X"), end at natural decision points, maintain consistent narrative elements
2. Content development: incorporate sensory details naturally, develop theme and moral teaching organically
3. Educational integration: balance entertainment with learning, ensure lessons feel organic to the story
4. Agency integration: weave the character's agency choice naturally throughout the story, showing its evolution and impact
```

### Further Streamlined System Prompt CRITICAL RULES

```
# CRITICAL RULES
1. **Narrative Structure**: Begin directly (never with "Chapter X"), end at natural decision points, maintain consistent elements
2. **Content Development**: Incorporate sensory details naturally, develop theme organically, balance entertainment with learning
3. **Educational Integration**: Ensure lessons feel organic to the story, never forced or artificial
4. **Agency Integration**: Weave the character's pivotal choice naturally throughout, showing its evolution and impact
5. **Choice Format**: Use <CHOICES> tags, format as "Choice [A/B/C]: [description]" on single lines, make choices meaningful and distinct
```

### Original User Prompt (Multiple Sections)

```
# Story Chapter Instructions
1. Establish the character's ordinary world through vivid sensory details
2. Introduce the main character and initial situation
3. Build towards a natural story decision point
4. End the scene at a moment of decision

# Agency Choice & Critical Requirements
The character must make a pivotal choice that will influence their entire journey:

## {agency_category_name}
{agency_options}

## Implementation Requirements
- Present distinct options that reflect different approaches or values
- Describe how these choices might influence the character's journey
- Make the options fit naturally within the story world
- End the chapter at this decision point

## Format Requirements
Use this EXACT format for the choices, with NO indentation and NO line breaks within choices:

<CHOICES>
Choice A: [First choice description]
Choice B: [Second choice description]
Choice C: [Third choice description]
</CHOICES>

## CRITICAL RULES
1. Format: Start and end with <CHOICES> tags on their own lines
2. Each choice: Begin with "Choice [A/B/C]: " and contain the complete description on a single line
3. Content: Make each choice meaningful, distinct, and advance the plot in interesting ways
4. Character Establishment: Choices should reveal character traits and establish initial direction
```

### Further Streamlined User Prompt (Consolidated)

```
# Chapter Development Guidelines
1. **Exposition Focus**: {exposition_focus}
2. **Character Introduction**: Establish the protagonist through vivid sensory details
3. **World Building**: Create an immersive setting using the sensory elements
4. **Decision Point**: Build naturally to a pivotal choice that will shape the character's journey

# Agency Options: {agency_category_name}
{agency_options}

# Choice Format Specification
<CHOICES>
Choice A: [Option that reveals character traits and establishes initial direction]
Choice B: [Option that offers a different approach or value system]
Choice C: [Option that presents an alternative path with unique consequences]
</CHOICES>
```

## Testing

To verify that the further streamlined prompts are being used correctly, run:

```bash
python -m app.services.llm.test_further_streamlined
```

This script:
1. Creates a sample AdventureState for the first chapter
2. Initializes the LLM service
3. Generates a chapter using the further streamlined prompts
4. Prints the results

The output should show:
- Debug messages indicating that further streamlined prompts are being used
- The system and user prompts being sent to the LLM
- A sample of the generated content

## Benefits

1. **Further Reduced Token Usage**:
   - Even more concise instructions
   - Eliminated redundant sections
   - More efficient use of token context window

2. **Improved LLM Comprehension**:
   - Clearer, more direct instructions
   - Better organization of related concepts
   - More consistent formatting

3. **Enhanced Maintainability**:
   - Cleaner code structure
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Easier to update and extend

4. **Better User Experience**:
   - More focused first chapter experience
   - Clearer agency choices
   - More natural narrative flow

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation focuses on further streamlining the first chapter prompt. Future enhancements could include:

1. Extending the further streamlined approach to other chapter types (LESSON, REFLECT, CONCLUSION)
2. Adding metrics to compare token usage between original, streamlined, and further streamlined prompts
3. Implementing A/B testing to compare LLM output quality
4. Further optimizing the prompts based on user feedback and performance data
