# Summary Chapter Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for migrating the Summary Chapter feature from the experimental React app to the production environment. The migration involves removing dependencies on the static JSON file and ensuring all components use the AdventureState data.

## Migration Steps

1. **Remove Static JSON Fallbacks**
   - [x] Update `summary_router.py` to remove fallbacks to static JSON file
   - [x] Update React component to not use default data
   - [x] Rebuild React app to reflect changes

2. **Update Testing Infrastructure**
   - [x] Create `test_summary_chapter.py` to test the summary chapter without generating all 10 chapters
   - [x] Ensure test script uses the permanent locations, not experimental ones

3. **Verify Data Flow**
   - [x] Confirm the summary chapter is reading from AdventureState
   - [x] Verify correct number of chapters and questions are displayed
   - [x] Test with simulation state files

4. **Clean Up**
   - [x] Remove any remaining references to the experimental directory
   - [x] Delete the experimental directory once migration is complete
   - [x] Update documentation to reflect the new architecture

## Implementation Details

### Static JSON Removal
- The `summary_router.py` file has been updated to remove fallbacks to the static JSON file
- The React component has been modified to not use default data and to handle errors gracefully
- The app has been rebuilt to reflect these changes

### Testing Infrastructure
- Created `tests/test_summary_chapter.py` to test the summary chapter without generating all 10 chapters
- The test script uses simulation state files to generate summary data
- The test script serves the React app from the permanent location (`app/static/summary-chapter/`)

### Data Flow Verification
- Confirmed the summary chapter is reading from AdventureState
- Verified correct number of chapters (10) and questions (3) are displayed
- Tested with simulation state files

### Clean Up
- Updated `tools/build_summary_app.py` to remove references to the experimental directory
- Modified the build script to use the permanent location for both source and destination
- Added comments explaining that the experimental directory has been removed
- Updated this document to mark all tasks as complete

## Build Process

The build process has been updated in `tools/build_summary_app.py` to:
1. Use the permanent location `app/static/summary-chapter/` as both source and destination
2. Remove all references to the experimental directory
3. Add appropriate comments explaining the changes

The migration is now complete, with all references to the experimental directory removed and the build script updated to reflect the new architecture.
