## Reverting Project to Last Git Commit (1/21/2025, 6:42:42 PM)

_**User**_

I want to revert my project to the last git commit.

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you revert your project to the last git commit. This will discard all uncommitted changes in your working directory. Let me check the git status first to see what changes would be reverted.

_**Assistant**_

```
git status | cat
```

I apologize for the error with the `cat` command in PowerShell. Let me modify the command to work properly in PowerShell:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
git status
```

_**Assistant**_



I see that you have:
1. Two modified files:
   - `.specstory/history/codebase-discussion-interactive-educational-stories.md`
   - `app/services/llm.py`
2. One untracked file:
   - `.specstory/history/formatting-issues-in-story-generation-output.md`

To revert to the last commit, I'll use `git restore` to discard the changes in the working directory. This will reset all tracked files to their state in the last commit. The untracked file will remain untouched.

_**Assistant**_

```
git restore .
```

_**Assistant**_



Let me verify that the changes have been reverted:

---

_**Assistant**_

```
git status
```

---

_**Assistant**_



Your project has been successfully reverted to the last commit. All changes in tracked files have been discarded. Note that the untracked file `.specstory/history/formatting-issues-in-story-generation-output.md` still remains in your workspace since it wasn't being tracked by git. If you want to remove it, you can delete it manually.
