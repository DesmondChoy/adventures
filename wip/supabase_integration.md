## Phase 1: Prerequisites & Setup ✅ COMPLETE
*Brief: All prerequisite steps for Supabase project creation, API key retrieval, library installation, and environment variable configuration are complete.*

- [x] Create Supabase Project & Find API Keys
- [x] Install Supabase Libraries (Backend: `supabase-py`, Frontend: `@supabase/supabase-js`)
- [x] Configure Environment Variables (Local and production via `.env` and Railway)

---

## Phase 2: Persistent Adventure State ✅ COMPLETE
*Brief: Successfully implemented persistent storage for adventure states using Supabase database, enabling adventure resumption.*

- [x] **Database Schema:** Created `adventures` table with columns for `id`, `user_id`, `state_data` (JSONB), `story_category`, `lesson_topic`, `is_complete`, `completed_chapter_count`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `environment`
- [x] **Backend Service:** Refactored `StateStorageService` to use Supabase with methods: `store_state`, `get_state`, `get_active_adventure_id`
- [x] **Integration:** WebSocket/API flow integration for state saving and resumption
- [x] **Environment Support:** Added environment column for dev/prod data separation

**Key Learnings:** JSONB storage works well for complex state data. Environment separation critical for development.

---

## Phase 3: Telemetry ✅ COMPLETE
*Brief: Successfully implemented telemetry logging to Supabase for key user and system events.*

- [x] **Database Schema:** Created `telemetry_events` table with dedicated columns for `chapter_type`, `chapter_number`, `event_duration_seconds`
- [x] **Backend Service:** Implemented `TelemetryService` with event logging for 'adventure_started', 'chapter_viewed', 'choice_made', 'summary_viewed'
- [x] **Duration Tracking:** Added time-based analytics for user engagement

**Key Learnings:** Dedicated columns for analytics are better than generic metadata for common queries.

---

## Phase 4: User Authentication ✅ COMPLETE
*Brief: Implemented optional user authentication using Supabase Auth with Google OAuth and anonymous sessions.*

### Implementation Summary:
- [x] **Login System:** Created `/` (login) and `/select` (carousel) page separation
- [x] **Frontend Auth:** Google OAuth and anonymous sign-in with session management
- [x] **Backend JWT:** JWT verification, user ID extraction, and service integration  
- [x] **Database Integration:** Foreign keys, RLS policies for user-scoped data access
- [x] **User ID Propagation:** All services (StateStorage, Telemetry) now user-aware

### Key Issues Resolved:
- **UUID Serialization:** Fixed `TypeError: Object of type UUID is not JSON serializable` by converting UUID to string
- **Missing User ID in Telemetry:** Updated all telemetry logging points to pass user_id correctly
- **RLS Policies:** Implemented proper row-level security for user data isolation

**Key Learnings:** JWT handling requires careful error handling. RLS policies essential for multi-user security.

  - Added `get_all_user_incomplete_adventures()` method to find ALL incomplete adventures.
  - Added `_abandon_all_incomplete_adventures()` method with detailed logging.
  - Updated `store_state()` to call comprehensive abandonment logic.
  - Added extensive debug logging with `[DUPLICATE_ADVENTURE_DEBUG]` prefix.
- **Result:** ✅ **VERIFIED WORKING** - Users now have only one incomplete adventure at a time.

#### ✅ COMPLETED/FIXED (CONTINUED):

**3. ✅ Resume Modal System (FIXED)**
- Created resume modal component (`app/templates/components/resume_modal.html`).
- **✅ NEW (2025-05-26 Evening):** Created custom conflict modal component (`app/templates/components/conflict_modal.html`) and associated CSS (`app/static/css/resume-modal.css`).
- Added API endpoints: `GET /api/user/current-adventure`, `POST /api/adventure/{id}/abandon`.
- Enhanced `/api/user/current-adventure` with comprehensive logging and validation.
- Implemented frontend logic in `login.html` (for resume modal) and `uiManager.js` (for conflict modal).
- Enhanced JWT authentication dependency with detailed logging.

- **Impact:** Both Google and Guest users now have the intended modal-guided UX flow.

#### ✅ COMPLETED/FIXED (FINAL):

**4. ✅ Chapter Display Issues (COMPLETELY FIXED - 2025-05-26 Evening)**
- **Root Cause Identified:** Multiple sources of chapter number calculation inconsistency:
  1. WebSocket router sending internal "next chapter" number instead of display number
  2. API endpoints (`/api/user/current-adventure` and `/api/adventure/active_by_client_uuid/{client_uuid}`) using same flawed logic
  3. Frontend accessing wrong data fields from server messages
- **Comprehensive Solution Implemented:**
  1. **WebSocket Router (`app/routers/websocket_router.py`):** Added logic to calculate correct display chapter number when resuming
  2. **API Endpoints (`app/routers/web.py`):** Created shared `calculate_display_chapter_number()` function and updated both API endpoints
  3. **Frontend (`app/static/js/uiManager.js`):** Updated to use correct server data fields (`data.current_chapter` instead of `data.state.current_chapter_index`)
- **Result:** ✅ **COMPLETELY VERIFIED WORKING** - All three locations (main app, resume modal, conflict modal) now show consistent and accurate chapter numbers.

## Architecture Decisions & Learnings

### Chapter Display Consistency Fix (2025-05-26)
**Problem:** Chapter display showed inconsistent numbers across different parts of the application when resuming adventures.

**Root Cause:** Multiple calculation points using different logic:
- WebSocket router: Sent internal "next chapter to generate" number (4) instead of displayed chapter (3)
- API endpoints: Used same flawed calculation for modal data
- Frontend: Accessed wrong data fields from server

**Solution:** Implemented unified chapter display calculation:
- Created shared `calculate_display_chapter_number()` function
- Applied consistent logic: if last chapter has no response (will be re-sent), show that chapter's number
- Updated all three locations to use the chapter number the user actually sees

**Technical Implementation:**
- **WebSocket Router:** Added display chapter calculation before sending `adventure_loaded` message
- **API Endpoints:** Shared function checks if chapter will be re-sent and calculates appropriate display number
- **Frontend:** Updated to use correct server data fields (`data.current_chapter` vs `data.state.current_chapter_index`)

**Key Learnings:**
- Chapter display logic must be centralized to ensure consistency
- Internal state tracking and user-facing display can differ - need clear separation
- All UI components accessing the same data must use identical calculation logic

### Multiple Adventure Prevention (2025-05-26)
**Problem:** Users could accumulate multiple incomplete adventures, violating the "one adventure per user" business rule.

**Root Cause:** The original abandonment logic used `.limit(1)` which only found the most recent incomplete adventure, leaving older ones untouched.

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive abandonment logic that finds and abandons ALL incomplete adventures for a user when starting a new one.

**Technical Implementation:**
- `get_all_user_incomplete_adventures()`: Queries ALL incomplete adventures (no limit)
- `_abandon_all_incomplete_adventures()`: Iterates through and abandons each one
- Extensive debug logging for traceability and monitoring
- Backward compatibility maintained

**Key Learnings:** 
- Database queries with `.limit(1)` can mask data integrity issues in business logic
- Comprehensive logging is essential for debugging complex state management
- Always consider edge cases where users might have accumulated problematic data over time

### Resume Modal Failure Analysis (2025-05-26)
**Problem:** Resume and Conflict modals do not appear for guest users after logout/login. Google Auth modals now work.

**Root Cause (Guest Login):** Inconsistent `user_id` for guest users across sessions. The Supabase anonymous authentication might generate a new `user_id` each time, or the session/JWT is not persisting/being re-established correctly for guests to maintain the same `user_id`. API calls to `/api/user/current-adventure` (which require a stable `user_id`) fail, so the modals are not triggered.

**Root Cause (Google Auth - Previously):** Likely JWT clock skew or session management issues, which seem to be resolved or less impactful now.

**Current Mitigation (Guest Login):** System falls back to `client_uuid` for adventure resumption, which works for continuing the adventure but bypasses the intended modal UX.

**Key Learnings (Updated 2025-05-26 Evening):**
- Fallback mechanisms (`client_uuid`) are crucial for core functionality but don't replace the intended UX.
- UX flows (especially modals) must be thoroughly tested across ALL authentication methods (Guest and Google).
- Guest user authentication and session management require specific attention to ensure `user_id` consistency if features depend on it. If `user_id` cannot be made stable for guests, features need alternative identifiers (like `client_uuid`) for API lookups.
- Custom modals significantly improve UX over native browser dialogs.

-   **Cross-Browser/Device:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari (if possible); Desktop, Mobile.
-   **Error Scenarios:** API failures, WebSocket disconnections, invalid data.
-   **Logout/Login Cycles:** Multiple cycles to check session stability.

### 2. Error Handling Enhancement (MEDIUM)
**Goal:** Improve user feedback when operations fail.
**Implementation Required:**
-   Enhanced error messages for API failures
-   Better WebSocket disconnection handling
-   User-friendly error recovery options

### 3. Minor Cleanup (LOW)
**Goal:** Clean up non-functional issues.
**Items:**
-   Fix ES6 module syntax error in `carousel-manager.js:247`
-   Remove or reduce debug logging in production
