        *   **✅ FIXED:** Resume modal flow for Guest users (localStorage key mismatch resolved).
        *   **✅ FIXED:** Conflict modal flow for Guest users (ES6 module loading and modal promise flow fixed).
        *   Backend API (`/api/user/current-adventure`) enhanced with detailed logging.
        *   `StateStorageService` updated with `get_user_current_adventure_for_resume` method.
        *   `login.html` updated with retry logic and comprehensive debugging.
        *   `uiManager.js` updated with custom conflict modal logic and comprehensive debugging.
        *   **✅ FIXED:** Multiple incomplete adventures per user issue resolved.
        *   **✅ FIXED:** Resume API KeyError resolved.
        *   **✅ FIXED:** ES6 module import path corrected in `scripts.html`.
        *   **✅ FIXED:** Modal flow improved (loader hidden before modal display).
        *   **❌ NOT FIXED:** Chapter display inconsistency not fully resolved.

*   **Testing Results (2025-05-26 Evening - UPDATED):**
    *   **Google Authentication:**
        *   **✅ VERIFIED WORKING:** Resume modal appears consistently.
        *   **✅ VERIFIED WORKING:** Custom conflict modal (for abandoning incomplete adventures) appears consistently and functions correctly on desktop and mobile.
        *   **✅ VERIFIED WORKING:** Adventure persistence and resumption.
        *   **✅ VERIFIED WORKING:** One adventure per user enforcement.
    *   **Guest Login:**
        *   **✅ VERIFIED WORKING:** Adventure persistence and resumption via `client_uuid` fallback (adventure resumes automatically).
        *   **✅ FIXED:** Resume modal now appears correctly after logout/login.
        *   **✅ FIXED:** Custom conflict modal now appears and functions correctly when trying to start a new adventure over an existing one.
        *   **✅ VERIFIED WORKING:** One adventure per user enforcement (likely due to `client_uuid` fallback and backend logic).
    *   **General:**
        *   **❌ INCONSISTENT:** Chapter display sometimes shows correct progress, sometimes doesn't (both auth types).
        *   **✅ VERIFIED WORKING:** Adventure state reconstruction from database.
        *   **⚠️ MINOR ISSUE:** ES6 module error in `carousel-manager.js:247` still present in console ("Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'export'") but does not affect functionality.
    *   **Root Cause RESOLVED for Guest Login Modal Issues:** localStorage key mismatch fixed (`'client_uuid'` vs `'learning_odyssey_user_uuid'`) and ES6 module import path corrected in `scripts.html`.

## Phase 1: Prerequisites & Setup ✅ COMPLETE
*Brief: All prerequisite steps for Supabase project creation, API key retrieval, library installation, and environment variable configuration are complete.*

- [x] Create Supabase Project & Find API Keys
- [x] Install Supabase Libraries (Backend: `supabase-py`, Frontend: `@supabase/supabase-js`)
- [x] Configure Environment Variables (Local and production via `.env` and Railway)

---

## Phase 2: Persistent Adventure State ✅ COMPLETE
*Brief: Successfully implemented persistent storage for adventure states using Supabase database, enabling adventure resumption.*

- [x] **Database Schema:** Created `adventures` table with columns for `id`, `user_id`, `state_data` (JSONB), `story_category`, `lesson_topic`, `is_complete`, `completed_chapter_count`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `environment`
- [x] **Backend Service:** Refactored `StateStorageService` to use Supabase with methods: `store_state`, `get_state`, `get_active_adventure_id`
- [x] **Integration:** WebSocket/API flow integration for state saving and resumption
- [x] **Environment Support:** Added environment column for dev/prod data separation

**Key Learnings:** JSONB storage works well for complex state data. Environment separation critical for development.

---

## Phase 3: Telemetry ✅ COMPLETE
*Brief: Successfully implemented telemetry logging to Supabase for key user and system events.*

- [x] **Database Schema:** Created `telemetry_events` table with dedicated columns for `chapter_type`, `chapter_number`, `event_duration_seconds`
- [x] **Backend Service:** Implemented `TelemetryService` with event logging for 'adventure_started', 'chapter_viewed', 'choice_made', 'summary_viewed'
- [x] **Duration Tracking:** Added time-based analytics for user engagement

**Key Learnings:** Dedicated columns for analytics are better than generic metadata for common queries.

---

## Phase 4: User Authentication ✅ COMPLETE
*Brief: Implemented optional user authentication using Supabase Auth with Google OAuth and anonymous sessions.*

### Implementation Summary:
- [x] **Login System:** Created `/` (login) and `/select` (carousel) page separation
- [x] **Frontend Auth:** Google OAuth and anonymous sign-in with session management
- [x] **Backend JWT:** JWT verification, user ID extraction, and service integration  
- [x] **Database Integration:** Foreign keys, RLS policies for user-scoped data access
- [x] **User ID Propagation:** All services (StateStorage, Telemetry) now user-aware

### Key Issues Resolved:
- **UUID Serialization:** Fixed `TypeError: Object of type UUID is not JSON serializable` by converting UUID to string
- **Missing User ID in Telemetry:** Updated all telemetry logging points to pass user_id correctly
- **RLS Policies:** Implemented proper row-level security for user data isolation

**Key Learnings:** JWT handling requires careful error handling. RLS policies essential for multi-user security.

## Phase 4.1: Adventure Resumption Bug Fix & Enhanced UX ❌ PARTIALLY WORKING WITH CRITICAL BUGS
*Brief: Attempted to address critical bugs in adventure resumption system. Some fixes implemented but major issues remain unresolved.*

### Root Problems Identified & Current Status:
1.  **✅ Adventure Matching Bug (FIXED):** Enhanced `get_active_adventure_id` with story/lesson-specific matching
2.  **❌ UX Enhancement (FAILING):** Resume modal system implemented but NOT WORKING reliably
3.  **✅ Multiple Adventures (FIXED):** Comprehensive abandonment logic prevents adventure accumulation
4.  **❌ Chapter Display Inconsistency (NOT FIXED):** Frontend still shows incorrect chapter progress inconsistently

### Implementation Status (Updated 2025-05-26 PM):

#### ✅ COMPLETED/FIXED:

**1. ✅ Adventure Matching Logic (`app/services/state_storage_service.py`)**
- Enhanced `get_active_adventure_id()` with `story_category` and `lesson_topic` parameters.
- Updated WebSocket router to pass story/lesson context when searching for adventures.
- Added `get_user_current_adventure_for_resume` to provide detailed data for modal and WebSocket URL.
- **Result:** ✅ **VERIFIED WORKING** - Adventures correctly match selection via client_uuid fallback.

**2. ✅ One Adventure Enforcement (`app/services/state_storage_service.py`) - MAJOR FIX**
- **Root Cause Identified:** Original abandonment logic only found most recent incomplete adventure.
- **Solution Implemented:** 
  - Added `get_all_user_incomplete_adventures()` method to find ALL incomplete adventures.
  - Added `_abandon_all_incomplete_adventures()` method with detailed logging.
  - Updated `store_state()` to call comprehensive abandonment logic.
  - Added extensive debug logging with `[DUPLICATE_ADVENTURE_DEBUG]` prefix.
- **Result:** ✅ **VERIFIED WORKING** - Users now have only one incomplete adventure at a time.

#### ❌ CRITICAL BUGS REMAINING:

**1. ❌ Resume Modal System (FAILING)**
- Created resume modal component (`app/templates/components/resume_modal.html`).
- **✅ NEW (2025-05-26 Evening):** Created custom conflict modal component (`app/templates/components/conflict_modal.html`) and associated CSS (`app/static/css/resume-modal.css`).
- Added API endpoints: `GET /api/user/current-adventure`, `POST /api/adventure/{id}/abandon`.
- Enhanced `/api/user/current-adventure` with comprehensive logging and validation.
- Implemented frontend logic in `login.html` (for resume modal) and `uiManager.js` (for conflict modal).
- Enhanced JWT authentication dependency with detailed logging.
- **✅ FIXED:** Resume API KeyError - proper field mapping implemented.
- **✅ FIXED (Google Auth):** Resume modal now appears consistently for Google authenticated users.
- **✅ FIXED (Google Auth):** Custom conflict modal appears consistently for Google authenticated users.
- **❌ CRITICAL BUG (Guest Login):** Resume modal does NOT appear after logout/login for guest users.
- **❌ CRITICAL BUG (Guest Login):** Custom conflict modal does NOT appear for guest users.
- **Updated Root Cause:** For Google Auth, previous JWT clock skew issues seem resolved or mitigated. For Guest Login, the primary issue is inconsistent `user_id` across sessions, causing API lookups for active adventures to fail.
- **Impact:** Google users now have the intended UX flow. Guest users can resume adventures via fallback but lack the modal-guided experience.

**2. ❌ Chapter Display Issues (NOT FULLY RESOLVED)**
- Enhanced `handleMessage` function for `adventure_loaded` events in `uiManager.js`.
- Added proper chapter progress calculation from server state.
- Added comprehensive logging for chapter display debugging.
- **❌ PERSISTENT BUG:** Chapter progress sometimes shows incorrectly (e.g., "Chapter 1 of 10" instead of "Chapter 3 of 10")
- **Root Cause:** Not fully diagnosed - frontend state interpretation issues persist
- **Impact:** Users see incorrect progress information when resuming adventures

### Testing Results (2025-05-26 PM):

#### ✅ **VERIFIED WORKING (Updated 2025-05-26 Evening):**
*   ✅ **Adventure Creation & Persistence** - Adventures saved correctly to database.
*   ✅ **Adventure Resumption via Fallback (`client_uuid`)** - Adventures resume correctly for guest users.
*   ✅ **Adventure Resumption via Modal (Google Auth)** - Adventures resume correctly via modal for Google users.
*   ✅ **Custom Conflict Modal (Google Auth)** - Works as expected for Google users on desktop and mobile.
*   ✅ **One Adventure Enforcement** - Multiple adventure accumulation prevented (backend logic and `client_uuid` fallback contribute).
*   ✅ **State Reconstruction** - Complex adventure state properly reconstructed from database.
*   ✅ **Story/Lesson Matching** - Adventures match correct story/lesson combinations.
*   ✅ **WebSocket Integration** - Seamless integration with WebSocket adventure flow.
*   ✅ **Content Loading** - Story content and choices load correctly on resume.

#### ❌ **CRITICAL BUGS IDENTIFIED (Updated 2025-05-26 Evening):**
*   **❌ Resume Modal Failure (Guest Login)** - Modal does NOT appear after logout/login for guest users.
*   **❌ Conflict Modal Failure (Guest Login)** - Custom conflict modal does NOT appear for guest users.
*   **❌ Chapter Display Bug** - Progress sometimes shows incorrect chapter numbers (both auth types).
*   **Identified Root Cause for Guest Modal Failures:** Inconsistent `user_id` for guest users across sessions. API calls for active adventure lookup (required for modals) fail.

#### ⚠️ **TEST COVERAGE (Updated 2025-05-26 Evening):**
*   **✅ Google Auth Tested:** Resume and conflict modals tested on desktop and mobile.
*   **✅ Guest Login Tested:** Basic adventure flow and `client_uuid` resumption tested. Modal failures confirmed.
*   **⚠️ Single Test Scenario per Auth Type:** Limited adventure progression testing.

### Testing Scenarios Completed (Updated 2025-05-26 Evening):
**Google Authentication:**
1. ✅ Log in with Google.
2. ✅ Start adventure (e.g., Enchanted Forest/Human Body), progress to Chapter 3.
3. ✅ Log out, log back in with Google.
4. ✅ **VERIFIED:** Resume modal appears with correct adventure details.
5. ✅ Click "Continue Adventure" - adventure resumes at Chapter 3.
6. ✅ Click "Learning Odyssey" banner (bypassing modal if it were to show again).
7. ✅ Select new adventure (e.g., Jade Mountain/Singapore History).
8. ✅ Click "Let's dive in!".
9. ✅ **VERIFIED:** Custom conflict modal appears, detailing current and new adventure.
10. ✅ Click "Abandon & Start New" - new adventure (Jade Mountain) starts correctly.

**Guest Login:**
1. ✅ Log in as guest.
2. ✅ Start adventure, progress to Chapter 3.
3. ✅ Log out, log back in as guest.
4. ✅ **VERIFIED:** Adventure resumes automatically at Chapter 3 (via `client_uuid` fallback).
5. ✅ **BUG:** Resume modal does NOT appear.
6. ✅ Click "Learning Odyssey" banner.
7. ✅ Select new adventure.
8. ✅ Click "Let's dive in!".
9. ✅ **BUG:** Custom conflict modal does NOT appear. Adventure still resumes old one (or starts new one without warning, depending on exact state of `client_uuid` and backend logic).
10. ✅ **State Integrity:** All adventure data preserved.
11. ✅ **Modal UX Failure (Guest):** Intended modal-guided user experience flow failed for guest users.

## Critical Issues Requiring Resolution

### High Priority (Blocking) - Updated 2025-05-26 Evening
1.  **Guest Login Modal Failures (Resume & Conflict)** - Critical UX failure for guest users.
    *   **Status:** ❌ NOT WORKING for guest users.
    *   **Root Cause:** Inconsistent `user_id` for guest users across sessions. API calls for active adventure lookup fail.
    *   **Impact:** Guest users lack modal-guided experience for resuming or abandoning adventures.

2.  **Chapter Display Inconsistency** - User confusion.
    *   **Status:** ❌ NOT FULLY RESOLVED (affects both auth types).
    *   **Root Cause:** Frontend state interpretation issues in `uiManager.js`.
    *   **Impact:** Users see incorrect progress information.

3.  **Ensure Guest User ID Stability or Fallback for Modals** - Technical requirement for guest UX.
    *   **Status:** ❌ NOT ADDRESSED.
    *   **Impact:** Without this, guest modal functionality cannot be reliably implemented.

### Medium Priority - Updated 2025-05-26 Evening
1.  **Comprehensive Testing (Guest & Google)** - Test all authentication methods, various adventure progressions, edge cases, and cross-browser/device scenarios.
2.  **Error Handling** - Improve user feedback when API calls or other critical operations fail, especially for guest users.

## Architecture Decisions & Learnings

### Multiple Adventure Prevention (2025-05-26)
**Problem:** Users could accumulate multiple incomplete adventures, violating the "one adventure per user" business rule.

**Root Cause:** The original abandonment logic used `.limit(1)` which only found the most recent incomplete adventure, leaving older ones untouched.

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive abandonment logic that finds and abandons ALL incomplete adventures for a user when starting a new one.

**Technical Implementation:**
- `get_all_user_incomplete_adventures()`: Queries ALL incomplete adventures (no limit)
- `_abandon_all_incomplete_adventures()`: Iterates through and abandons each one
- Extensive debug logging for traceability and monitoring
- Backward compatibility maintained

**Key Learnings:** 
- Database queries with `.limit(1)` can mask data integrity issues in business logic
- Comprehensive logging is essential for debugging complex state management
- Always consider edge cases where users might have accumulated problematic data over time

### Resume Modal Failure Analysis (2025-05-26)
**Problem:** Resume and Conflict modals do not appear for guest users after logout/login. Google Auth modals now work.

**Root Cause (Guest Login):** Inconsistent `user_id` for guest users across sessions. The Supabase anonymous authentication might generate a new `user_id` each time, or the session/JWT is not persisting/being re-established correctly for guests to maintain the same `user_id`. API calls to `/api/user/current-adventure` (which require a stable `user_id`) fail, so the modals are not triggered.

**Root Cause (Google Auth - Previously):** Likely JWT clock skew or session management issues, which seem to be resolved or less impactful now.

**Current Mitigation (Guest Login):** System falls back to `client_uuid` for adventure resumption, which works for continuing the adventure but bypasses the intended modal UX.

**Key Learnings (Updated 2025-05-26 Evening):**
- Fallback mechanisms (`client_uuid`) are crucial for core functionality but don't replace the intended UX.
- UX flows (especially modals) must be thoroughly tested across ALL authentication methods (Guest and Google).
- Guest user authentication and session management require specific attention to ensure `user_id` consistency if features depend on it. If `user_id` cannot be made stable for guests, features need alternative identifiers (like `client_uuid`) for API lookups.
- Custom modals significantly improve UX over native browser dialogs.

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order - Updated 2025-05-26 Evening)

### 1. Fix Guest Login Modal Issues (CRITICAL)
**Goal:** Ensure Resume and Conflict modals appear consistently for Guest Users.
**Investigation & Implementation Required:**
-   **Analyze Guest Auth Flow:** Deep dive into `authManager.js` and Supabase anonymous sign-in. Determine why `user_id` is not stable across guest sessions or why JWT token might not be passed correctly for API calls after re-login.
-   **Option A (Preferred): Stabilize Guest `user_id`:** If possible, modify guest session handling to maintain a consistent `user_id` across logout/login cycles (e.g., by storing/retrieving a guest-specific identifier in `localStorage` that maps to a Supabase user).
-   **Option B (Fallback): Modify Modal Trigger Logic for Guests:** If guest `user_id` cannot be stabilized, update `login.html` (for resume modal) and `uiManager.js` (for conflict modal) to use `client_uuid` (from `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`) to fetch adventure details for guest users. This might involve:
    *   A new API endpoint like `/api/adventure/details_by_client_uuid/{client_uuid}`.
    *   Or, enhancing `/api/user/current-adventure` to optionally accept `client_uuid` if `user_id` is unavailable or indicates a guest.
-   **Test Thoroughly:** Verify modal appearance and functionality for guest users on desktop and mobile.

### 2. Resolve Chapter Display Bug (HIGH)
**Goal:** Ensure chapter progress is displayed consistently and accurately.
**Investigation Required:**
-   Thoroughly test chapter display across different resume scenarios (Google & Guest).
-   Debug frontend state interpretation in `uiManager.js` (`handleMessage` for `adventure_loaded`).
-   Verify server state (`state_data.chapters`, `state_data.story_length`) consistency with frontend display.
-   Add more detailed logging in `uiManager.js` around `updateProgress` calls.

### 3. Comprehensive Testing (MEDIUM)
**Goal:** Ensure overall application stability and robustness.
**Test Scenarios Required:**
-   **Authentication Methods:** Guest login, Google OAuth.
-   **Adventure Flows:** Start new, resume, abandon via modal, abandon by starting new.
-   **Progress Points:** Test resumption and conflicts at various chapter numbers.
-   **Cross-Browser/Device:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari (if possible); Desktop, Mobile.
-   **Error Scenarios:** API failures, WebSocket disconnections, invalid data.
-   **Logout/Login Cycles:** Multiple cycles to check session stability.

## Current Status Assessment

**Overall Status: ⚠️ IMPROVED BUT NOT PRODUCTION READY (Updated 2025-05-26 Evening)**

**Reasons:**
-   **Critical Guest Login UX Bugs:** Resume and Conflict modals are not working for guest users, significantly degrading their experience.
-   **Chapter Display Bugs Persist:** Incorrect chapter progress display causes user confusion.
-   **Limited Comprehensive Testing:** While specific scenarios were tested, broader testing is still needed.

**What Works (Updated):**
-   **Google Authentication Flow:** Resume and Conflict modals work reliably.
-   Adventure persistence and storage.
-   Fallback resumption mechanism via `client_uuid` (ensures guest adventures can continue, albeit without modals).
-   Data integrity enforcement (one adventure per user).
-   Basic adventure flow when modal issues are bypassed (for guests) or handled (for Google users).
-   Custom conflict modal provides good UX for Google users.

**What Doesn't Work (Updated):**
-   **Guest Login Modal UX:** Resume and Conflict modals fail for guest users.
-   Consistent chapter progress display (both auth types).
-   Full intended user experience for adventure resumption/conflict for guest users.

**Recommendation:** Prioritize fixing guest login modal issues. The application is approaching a better state for Google authenticated users, but guest user experience remains significantly compromised. After guest issues are resolved, focus on the chapter display bug and then conduct comprehensive testing.

---

This integration provides a foundation for user authentication and adventure persistence. Google authenticated users now have a significantly improved UX for adventure resumption and conflict handling. However, critical UX bugs for guest users and persistent chapter display issues prevent production readiness. The system works via fallback mechanisms for guests, but the intended modal-guided experience is missing for them.
