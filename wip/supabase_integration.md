## Phase 1: Prerequisites & Setup ‚úÖ COMPLETE
*Brief: All prerequisite steps for Supabase project creation, API key retrieval, library installation, and environment variable configuration are complete.*

- [x] Create Supabase Project & Find API Keys
- [x] Install Supabase Libraries (Backend: `supabase-py`, Frontend: `@supabase/supabase-js`)
- [x] Configure Environment Variables (Local and production via `.env` and Railway)

---

## Phase 2: Persistent Adventure State ‚úÖ COMPLETE
*Brief: Successfully implemented persistent storage for adventure states using Supabase database, enabling adventure resumption.*

- [x] **Database Schema:** Created `adventures` table with columns for `id`, `user_id`, `state_data` (JSONB), `story_category`, `lesson_topic`, `is_complete`, `completed_chapter_count`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `environment`
- [x] **Backend Service:** Refactored `StateStorageService` to use Supabase with methods: `store_state`, `get_state`, `get_active_adventure_id`
- [x] **Integration:** WebSocket/API flow integration for state saving and resumption
- [x] **Environment Support:** Added environment column for dev/prod data separation

**Key Learnings:** JSONB storage works well for complex state data. Environment separation critical for development.

---

## Phase 3: Telemetry ‚úÖ COMPLETE
*Brief: Successfully implemented telemetry logging to Supabase for key user and system events.*

- [x] **Database Schema:** Created `telemetry_events` table with dedicated columns for `chapter_type`, `chapter_number`, `event_duration_seconds`
- [x] **Backend Service:** Implemented `TelemetryService` with event logging for 'adventure_started', 'chapter_viewed', 'choice_made', 'summary_viewed'
- [x] **Duration Tracking:** Added time-based analytics for user engagement

**Key Learnings:** Dedicated columns for analytics are better than generic metadata for common queries.

---

## Phase 4: User Authentication ‚úÖ COMPLETE
*Brief: Implemented optional user authentication using Supabase Auth with Google OAuth and anonymous sessions.*

### Implementation Summary:
- [x] **Login System:** Created `/` (login) and `/select` (carousel) page separation
- [x] **Frontend Auth:** Google OAuth and anonymous sign-in with session management
- [x] **Backend JWT:** JWT verification, user ID extraction, and service integration  
- [x] **Database Integration:** Foreign keys, RLS policies for user-scoped data access
- [x] **User ID Propagation:** All services (StateStorage, Telemetry) now user-aware

### Key Issues Resolved:
- **UUID Serialization:** Fixed `TypeError: Object of type UUID is not JSON serializable` by converting UUID to string
- **Missing User ID in Telemetry:** Updated all telemetry logging points to pass user_id correctly
- **RLS Policies:** Implemented proper row-level security for user data isolation

**Key Learnings:** JWT handling requires careful error handling. RLS policies essential for multi-user security.

## Phase 4.1: Adventure Resumption Bug Fix & Enhanced UX üü° PARTIAL
*Brief: Addressed critical bug where users couldn't start new adventures with different story/lesson combinations, and implemented resume modal for better UX.*

### Root Problems Identified:
1. **Adventure Matching Bug:** `get_active_adventure_id` found ANY incomplete adventure, not story/lesson-specific ones
2. **Poor UX:** No clear resumption flow, users "trapped" in previous adventure selections
3. **Multiple Adventures:** Users could accumulate multiple incomplete adventures

### Solution Approach: Enhanced Resume Flow + Story/Lesson Filtering
- **One Adventure Per User:** Automatic abandonment of old adventures when starting new ones
- **Resume Modal:** Clean, professional modal showing adventure details with Continue/Start Fresh options
- **Story/Lesson Matching:** Only resume adventures that match current selection
- **30-Day Auto-Expiry:** Cleanup system for old adventures

### Implementation Status:

#### ‚úÖ COMPLETED FIXES:
**1. Adventure Matching Logic (`app/services/state_storage_service.py`)**
- Enhanced `get_active_adventure_id()` with `story_category` and `lesson_topic` parameters
- Updated WebSocket router to pass story/lesson context when searching for adventures
- **Result:** Adventures now only resume when they match user's current selection

**2. Resume Modal System**
- Created modal component (`app/templates/components/resume_modal.html`) with professional design
- Added API endpoints: `GET /api/user/current-adventure`, `POST /api/adventure/{id}/abandon`
- Implemented frontend logic for modal interaction and navigation
- **Result:** Users can explicitly choose to continue or start fresh

**3. One Adventure Enforcement**
- Added `_abandon_existing_incomplete_adventure()` helper in `StateStorageService`
- Modified `store_state()` to automatically abandon old adventures before creating new ones
- **Result:** Users limited to one incomplete adventure at a time

**4. Session Bypass Fix (`app/templates/pages/login.html`)**
- Fixed issue where existing Google sessions bypassed adventure checking
- Updated `checkLoginPageSession()` to call `handleSignIn()` instead of direct redirect
- **Result:** Login flow now properly checks for existing adventures

#### ‚ùå REMAINING ISSUES:

**Issue 1: Resume Modal Not Appearing**
- **Symptom:** After logout/login, modal doesn't appear despite incomplete adventure in database
- **Suspected Causes:** 
  - API endpoint not being called during login
  - Authentication token issues
  - User ID mismatch between JWT and database
- **Investigation Needed:** Check browser network tab, verify API response, validate user ID matching

**Issue 2: Chapter Display Inconsistency** 
- **Symptom:** UI shows "Chapter 1 out of 10" but displays Chapter 3 content
- **Suspected Causes:**
  - Frontend display logic using wrong chapter number source
  - Mismatch between `current_chapter_number` and `completed_chapter_count`
  - Adventure state loading correctly but UI counter incorrect
- **Investigation Needed:** Check chapter numbering logic in frontend, verify state data consistency

### Testing Progress:
‚úÖ **Working:** In-session resumption (browser refresh), adventure story/lesson matching, content loading
‚ùå **Failing:** Cross-session resumption (logout/login), chapter number display accuracy

---

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)

### 1. Debug Resume Modal Issue (HIGH)
**Investigation Tasks:**
- Check if `/api/user/current-adventure` is called during login (browser network tab)
- Verify API response and authentication token validity
- Compare user_id in JWT vs database records
- Test with different user types (Google vs Anonymous)

**Potential Fixes:**
- Fix user ID matching logic
- Correct API endpoint calling
- Resolve authentication token passing

### 2. Fix Chapter Display Bug (MEDIUM)
**Investigation Tasks:**
- Identify source of "Chapter X out of Y" display data
- Check if using `current_chapter_number` vs `completed_chapter_count`
- Verify adventure state reconstruction accuracy

**Potential Fixes:**
- Correct frontend chapter counter logic
- Ensure consistent chapter numbering across state management

### 3. Comprehensive Testing (MEDIUM)
**Test Scenarios:**
- Resume modal appearance and functionality
- One adventure limit enforcement
- Cross-session adventure persistence
- Different user types (Google, Anonymous)

### 4. Future Enhancements (LOW)
- Image persistence for resumed chapters (store in Supabase Storage)
- Adventure expiry automation (integrate cleanup into login flow)
- Enhanced analytics and user journey tracking

- **Foreign Keys with SET NULL:** Graceful handling of user deletion
- **Environment Separation:** Critical for development/production data isolation

### Authentication Flow
- **Optional Auth:** Support both authenticated and anonymous users seamlessly
- **JWT Backend Verification:** Essential for secure user identification
- **RLS Policies:** Row-level security ensures proper data isolation
- **Session Management:** Leverage Supabase client defaults for session persistence

### User Experience
- **Explicit Control:** Resume modal gives users clear choice vs automatic resumption
- **Professional Design:** Clean, branded interface without clutter
- **One Adventure Limit:** Simplifies user experience and prevents confusion
- **Story/Lesson Matching:** Prevents incorrect adventure resumption

### Performance Considerations
- **Efficient Queries:** Filter by user_id, story, lesson, completion status
- **State Size Management:** Monitor JSONB size, consider image storage alternatives
- **Cleanup Automation:** 30-day expiry prevents database bloat

---

## Future Enhancements

### Chapter Image Persistence
**Current:** Images not re-displayed on chapter resume (Chapters 1-9)
**Options:**
1. Store base64 in state data (simple, increases size)
2. Use Supabase Storage with URLs (scalable, requires setup)

### Advanced Analytics
- User journey mapping
- Chapter completion rates
- Story/lesson popularity metrics
- Session duration analysis

### Enhanced Resume Features
- Multiple adventure management
- Adventure sharing between users
- Save points within chapters
- Adventure templates and customization
