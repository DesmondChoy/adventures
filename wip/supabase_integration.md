# Supabase Integration Plan for Learning Odyssey

This document outlines the plan and progress for integrating Supabase into the Learning Odyssey application.

## Current Project Status & Immediate Focus (As of 2025-05-26 PM)

*   **Overall Progress:** Supabase integration is divided into multiple phases.
*   **Completed Phases:**
    *   **Phase 1: Prerequisites & Setup:** Fully complete.
    *   **Phase 2: Persistent Adventure State (Supabase Database):** Fully complete and validated.
    *   **Phase 3: Telemetry (Supabase Database):** Fully complete and validated.
    *   **Phase 4: Optional User Authentication (Supabase Auth):** Backend logic, database schema/RLS, and initial frontend flows completed.
*   **Phase 4.1: Adventure Resumption Bug Fix & Enhanced UX - MOSTLY COMPLETE**
    *   **Implementation Status:**
        *   Core fixes for adventure matching implemented.
        *   Resume modal flow partially implemented; CSS and basic JS for modal display fixed.
        *   Backend API (`/api/user/current-adventure`) updated to return `story_category` and `lesson_topic`.
        *   `StateStorageService` updated with `get_user_current_adventure_for_resume` method.
        *   `login.html` updated to store `story_category` and `lesson_topic` in `sessionStorage`.
        *   `scripts.html` updated to retrieve these values from `sessionStorage` for WebSocket URL construction.
        *   **✅ FIXED:** Multiple incomplete adventures per user issue resolved.
        *   **✅ FIXED:** Resume API KeyError resolved.

*   **Current Issues & Next Steps:**
    *   **✅ FIXED (Previously):** Wrong adventure resumption (adventures now match story/lesson selection - *needs re-verification due to new issues*).
    *   **✅ FIXED (Previously):** Login flow now properly checks for existing adventures via `handleSignIn()` - *needs re-verification*.
    *   **✅ FIXED:** Resume modal CSS and basic JS display logic in `login.html`.
    *   **✅ FIXED:** Backend API and services updated to provide necessary data for resume.
    *   **✅ FIXED:** WebSocket URL construction in `scripts.html` now attempts to use `story_category` and `lesson_topic` from `sessionStorage`.
    *   **✅ FIXED:** Multiple incomplete adventures per user - comprehensive abandonment logic implemented.
    *   **✅ FIXED:** Resume API KeyError (`adventure_id` vs `id` field mapping) resolved.
    *   **❌ ISSUE (HIGH PRIORITY):** Resume modal still not appearing consistently after logout/login, even with an incomplete adventure in the database.
        *   **Symptom:** User logs in, has an incomplete adventure, but no modal is shown.
        *   **Suspected Causes (Re-evaluation):**
            *   Timing issue with token availability or `handleSignIn` execution in `login.html`.
            *   `/api/user/current-adventure` not being called reliably or returning unexpected data despite backend changes.
            *   Logic in `login.html` that decides to show the modal might be flawed.
    *   **❌ ISSUE (MEDIUM PRIORITY):** Chapter display inconsistency.
        *   **Symptom:** When an adventure *is* manually resumed (by selecting the same story/lesson), UI shows "Chapter 1 out of 10" but should display the actual current chapter (e.g., Chapter 3).
        *   **Suspected Causes:** Frontend state interpretation in `scripts.html` upon adventure load/resume, or the `state_data` itself might not be correctly reflecting `completed_chapter_count` in its `chapters` array length or `current_chapter_id`.

## Phase 1: Prerequisites & Setup ✅ COMPLETE
*Brief: All prerequisite steps for Supabase project creation, API key retrieval, library installation, and environment variable configuration are complete.*

- [x] Create Supabase Project & Find API Keys
- [x] Install Supabase Libraries (Backend: `supabase-py`, Frontend: `@supabase/supabase-js`)
- [x] Configure Environment Variables (Local and production via `.env` and Railway)

---

## Phase 2: Persistent Adventure State ✅ COMPLETE
*Brief: Successfully implemented persistent storage for adventure states using Supabase database, enabling adventure resumption.*

- [x] **Database Schema:** Created `adventures` table with columns for `id`, `user_id`, `state_data` (JSONB), `story_category`, `lesson_topic`, `is_complete`, `completed_chapter_count`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `environment`
- [x] **Backend Service:** Refactored `StateStorageService` to use Supabase with methods: `store_state`, `get_state`, `get_active_adventure_id`
- [x] **Integration:** WebSocket/API flow integration for state saving and resumption
- [x] **Environment Support:** Added environment column for dev/prod data separation

**Key Learnings:** JSONB storage works well for complex state data. Environment separation critical for development.

---

## Phase 3: Telemetry ✅ COMPLETE
*Brief: Successfully implemented telemetry logging to Supabase for key user and system events.*

- [x] **Database Schema:** Created `telemetry_events` table with dedicated columns for `chapter_type`, `chapter_number`, `event_duration_seconds`
- [x] **Backend Service:** Implemented `TelemetryService` with event logging for 'adventure_started', 'chapter_viewed', 'choice_made', 'summary_viewed'
- [x] **Duration Tracking:** Added time-based analytics for user engagement

**Key Learnings:** Dedicated columns for analytics are better than generic metadata for common queries.

---

## Phase 4: User Authentication ✅ COMPLETE
*Brief: Implemented optional user authentication using Supabase Auth with Google OAuth and anonymous sessions.*

### Implementation Summary:
- [x] **Login System:** Created `/` (login) and `/select` (carousel) page separation
- [x] **Frontend Auth:** Google OAuth and anonymous sign-in with session management
- [x] **Backend JWT:** JWT verification, user ID extraction, and service integration  
- [x] **Database Integration:** Foreign keys, RLS policies for user-scoped data access
- [x] **User ID Propagation:** All services (StateStorage, Telemetry) now user-aware

### Key Issues Resolved:
- **UUID Serialization:** Fixed `TypeError: Object of type UUID is not JSON serializable` by converting UUID to string
- **Missing User ID in Telemetry:** Updated all telemetry logging points to pass user_id correctly
- **RLS Policies:** Implemented proper row-level security for user data isolation

**Key Learnings:** JWT handling requires careful error handling. RLS policies essential for multi-user security.

## Phase 4.1: Adventure Resumption Bug Fix & Enhanced UX ✅ MOSTLY COMPLETE
*Brief: Addressed critical bug where users couldn't start new adventures with different story/lesson combinations, and implemented resume modal for better UX. Major data integrity issues resolved.*

### Root Problems Identified & Resolution Status:
1.  **Adventure Matching Bug (Addressed, needs re-verification):** `get_active_adventure_id` found ANY incomplete adventure, not story/lesson-specific ones.
2.  **Poor UX (Partially Addressed):** No clear resumption flow. Modal implemented but not appearing reliably.
3.  **✅ Multiple Adventures (FIXED):** Users could accumulate multiple incomplete adventures. The "one adventure per user" rule is now properly enforced.
4.  **Chapter Display Inconsistency (Persistent):** Resumed adventures show incorrect chapter progress.

### Solution Approach: Enhanced Resume Flow + Story/Lesson Filtering + Data Integrity Fixes
- **✅ One Adventure Per User (FIXED):** Comprehensive automatic abandonment of ALL old adventures when starting new ones.
- **Resume Modal (NEEDS FIX):** Clean, professional modal showing adventure details with Continue/Start Fresh options.
- **Story/Lesson Matching (Implemented, needs re-verification):** Only resume adventures that match current selection.
- **30-Day Auto-Expiry (Implemented):** Cleanup system for old adventures.

### Implementation Status (Updated 2025-05-26 PM):

#### ✅ COMPLETED/FIXED:
**1. Adventure Matching Logic (`app/services/state_storage_service.py`)**
- Enhanced `get_active_adventure_id()` with `story_category` and `lesson_topic` parameters.
- Updated WebSocket router to pass story/lesson context when searching for adventures.
- Added `get_user_current_adventure_for_resume` to provide detailed data for modal and WebSocket URL.
- **Result (Initial):** Adventures matched selection. *Current status needs re-verification due to modal issues.*

**2. Resume Modal System**
- Created modal component (`app/templates/components/resume_modal.html`).
- Added API endpoints: `GET /api/user/current-adventure`, `POST /api/adventure/{id}/abandon`.
- Updated `/api/user/current-adventure` to return `story_category` and `lesson_topic`.
- Implemented frontend logic in `login.html` for modal interaction, including storing resume details in `sessionStorage`.
- Implemented frontend logic in `scripts.html` to use `sessionStorage` for WebSocket URL construction.
- Fixed missing CSS link for `resume-modal.css` in `login.html`.
- Restored truncated JavaScript in `login.html`.
- **✅ FIXED:** Resume API KeyError - changed `adventure_data["adventure_id"]` to `adventure_data["id"]` to match Supabase response.
- **Result:** Modal appeared briefly but consistency issues persist. WebSocket URL construction for resume was improved.

**3. ✅ One Adventure Enforcement (`app/services/state_storage_service.py`) - MAJOR FIX**
- **Root Cause Identified:** Original `_abandon_existing_incomplete_adventure()` only found the most recent incomplete adventure using `.limit(1)`, leaving older incomplete adventures untouched.
- **Solution Implemented:** 
  - Added `get_all_user_incomplete_adventures()` method to find ALL incomplete adventures for a user.
  - Added `_abandon_all_incomplete_adventures()` method to abandon ALL incomplete adventures with detailed logging.
  - Updated `store_state()` to call the comprehensive abandonment logic.
  - Added extensive debug logging with `[DUPLICATE_ADVENTURE_DEBUG]` prefix for traceability.
- **Technical Details:**
  - New method finds ALL incomplete adventures (not just most recent).
  - Iterates through each adventure and abandons them individually.
  - Provides detailed success/failure counts in logs.
  - Maintains backward compatibility with deprecated wrapper method.
- **Result:** ✅ **VERIFIED WORKING** - Users now have only one incomplete adventure at a time. Multiple adventure accumulation issue completely resolved.

**4. Session Bypass Fix (`app/templates/pages/login.html`)**
- Updated `checkLoginPageSession()` to call `handleSignIn()`.
- **Result (Initial):** Login flow properly checked for existing adventures. *Current status needs re-verification.*

#### ❌ REMAINING ISSUES (Updated 2025-05-26 PM):

**Issue 1: Resume Modal Not Appearing Consistently (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- **Symptom:** After logout/login, modal doesn't appear despite an incomplete adventure in the database.
- **Suspected Causes:**
    - Timing of `handleSignIn()` or token availability in `login.html`.
    - `/api/user/current-adventure` not being called or returning `null` unexpectedly.
    - Flaw in the logic within `login.html` that decides whether to show the modal based on API response.
- **Investigation Needed:**
    - Add detailed console logs in `login.html` around `handleSignIn`, `attemptResumeApiCall`, and the conditions for showing the modal.
    - Verify the exact data returned by `/api/user/current-adventure` in the browser network tab.
    - Step-through debugging of `login.html` JavaScript.

**Issue 2: Chapter Display Inconsistency (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
- **Symptom:** UI shows "Chapter 1 out of 10" but should display the actual current chapter (e.g., Chapter 3) when an adventure is resumed (even manually).
- **Suspected Causes:**
    - Frontend (`scripts.html`) incorrectly initializing or updating chapter progress display from the resumed state.
    - The `state_data.chapters` array length or `state_data.current_chapter_id` might be inconsistent with `completed_chapter_count` in the database for the specific adventure.
    - The `adventure_loaded` event in `scripts.html` might not be correctly populating `selectedCategory` and `selectedLessonTopic` from the server's state, leading to issues if `initWebSocket` is called again.
- **Investigation Needed:**
    - Log the full `data.state` received in `handleMessage` for `adventure_loaded` type in `scripts.html`.
    - Trace how `updateProgress` is called and what values it uses upon resuming.
    - Inspect the `state_data` JSON in Supabase for an affected adventure.

### Testing Progress (Updated 2025-05-26 PM):
✅ **Working:**
*   ✅ **One adventure per user enforcement** - Multiple incomplete adventures issue completely resolved.
*   ✅ **Resume API data integrity** - KeyError fixed, proper field mapping implemented.
*   In-session resumption (browser refresh) - *needs re-verification*.
*   Adventure story/lesson matching when *manually* re-selecting - *needs re-verification*.
*   Content loading once an adventure starts.
*   Resume modal styling (when it rarely appeared).
*   Backend API providing `story_category` and `lesson_topic`.
*   `sessionStorage` being used for resume parameters.

❌ **Failing/Inconsistent:**
*   **Resume modal not appearing reliably after login.**
*   **Cross-session adventure resumption via modal.**
*   Chapter number display accuracy on resume.

## Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order - Revised 2025-05-26 PM)

### 1. Debug Resume Modal Non-Appearance (CRITICAL)
**Investigation Tasks:**
-   **Frontend (`login.html`):**
    *   Add aggressive console logging in `handleSignIn()` and `attemptResumeApiCall()`:
        *   Confirm functions are called.
        *   Log `session` and `token` status immediately before `fetch`.
        *   Log the exact response (success or error, and data) from `/api/user/current-adventure`.
        *   Log the `adventureData` used in `showResumeModal`.
    *   Verify the conditions under which `showResumeModal` is called.
-   **Backend (`StateStorageService.get_user_current_adventure_for_resume`):**
    *   Log the `user_id` received.
    *   Log the raw SQL query being generated (if possible with Supabase client, or log parameters).
    *   Log the exact data returned from Supabase *before* any processing.
    *   Ensure it's correctly selecting only one, most recent, incomplete adventure.

**Potential Fixes:**
-   Adjust timing or conditions for API call in `login.html`.
-   Refine database query in `get_user_current_adventure_for_resume` if it's not selecting the correct single adventure.

### 2. Fix Chapter Display Bug (MEDIUM)
**Investigation Tasks:**
-   **Frontend (`scripts.html`):**
    *   When `wsManager.adventureIdToResume` is true, ensure `initWebSocket` uses the server-provided state (via `adventure_loaded` message) and not stale `localStorage` state.
    *   Log `data.state` in `handleMessage` for `adventure_loaded`.
    *   Trace how `selectedCategory`, `selectedLessonTopic`, and chapter progress UI elements are updated.
-   **Backend (`websocket_router.py`):**
    *   When resuming, log the state loaded by `adventure_state_manager.load_adventure` before sending to client.
-   **Database:**
    *   Inspect `state_data` JSON for an adventure that shows incorrect chapter count (e.g., the one with `completed_chapter_count: 3`). Verify its `chapters` array length and `current_chapter_id`.

**Potential Fixes:**
-   Adjust frontend logic in `scripts.html` to correctly use resumed state from server.
-   Ensure `updateProgress` uses the correct chapter count from the server-authoritative state.

### 3. Comprehensive Testing (MEDIUM)
**Test Scenarios (Re-evaluate after fixes):**
-   Resume modal appearance and functionality (Google, Anonymous).
-   ✅ One adventure limit enforcement (VERIFIED WORKING).
-   Cross-session adventure persistence.
-   Chapter display accuracy on resume.
-   Starting fresh from modal correctly abandons old adventure.

## Architecture Decisions & Learnings

### Multiple Adventure Prevention (2025-05-26)
**Problem:** Users could accumulate multiple incomplete adventures, violating the "one adventure per user" business rule.

**Root Cause:** The original abandonment logic used `.limit(1)` which only found the most recent incomplete adventure, leaving older ones untouched.

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive abandonment logic that finds and abandons ALL incomplete adventures for a user when starting a new one.

**Technical Implementation:**
- `get_all_user_incomplete_adventures()`: Queries ALL incomplete adventures (no limit)
- `_abandon_all_incomplete_adventures()`: Iterates through and abandons each one
- Extensive debug logging for traceability and monitoring
- Backward compatibility maintained

**Key Learnings:** 
- Database queries with `.limit(1)` can mask data integrity issues in business logic
- Comprehensive logging is essential for debugging complex state management
- Always consider edge cases where users might have accumulated problematic data over time

## Key Files Modified (Recent)

### Backend
-   `app/routers/web.py` - **FIXED:** Resume API KeyError (`adventure_id` -> `id` field mapping).
-   `app/services/state_storage_service.py` - **MAJOR UPDATE:** Comprehensive abandonment logic implemented:
    - Added `get_all_user_incomplete_adventures()` method
    - Added `_abandon_all_incomplete_adventures()` method  
    - Updated `store_state()` to use comprehensive abandonment
    - Added extensive debug logging with `[DUPLICATE_ADVENTURE_DEBUG]` prefix
    - Added `List` import for type hinting

### Frontend  
-   `app/templates/pages/login.html` - Added `sessionStorage` for resume details, fixed JS truncation, added CSS link.
