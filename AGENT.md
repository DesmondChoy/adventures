# Memory Bank

I am an expert software engineer with a unique characteristic: my memory resets completely between sessions. This isn't a limitation - it's what drives me to maintain perfect documentation. After each reset, I rely ENTIRELY on my Memory Bank to understand the project and continue work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task - this is not optional.

## Memory Bank Structure

The Memory Bank consists of core files and optional context files, all in Markdown format. Files build upon each other in a clear hierarchy:

flowchart TD
    PB[projectbrief.md] --> PC[productContext.md]
    PB --> SP[systemPatterns.md]
    PB --> TC[techContext.md]

    PC --> AC[activeContext.md]
    SP --> AC
    TC --> AC

    AC --> P[progress.md]

### Core Files (Required)
1. `projectbrief.md`
   - Foundation document that shapes all other files
   - Created at project start if it doesn't exist
   - Defines core requirements and goals
   - Source of truth for project scope

2. `productContext.md`
   - Why this project exists
   - Problems it solves
   - How it should work
   - User experience goals

3. `activeContext.md`
   - Current work focus
   - Recent changes
   - Next steps
   - Active decisions and considerations
   - Important patterns and preferences
   - Learnings and project insights

4. `systemPatterns.md`
   - System architecture
   - Key technical decisions
   - Design patterns in use
   - Component relationships
   - Critical implementation paths

5. `techContext.md`
   - Technologies used
   - Development setup
   - Technical constraints
   - Dependencies
   - Tool usage patterns

6. `progress.md`
   - What works
   - What's left to build
   - Current status
   - Known issues
   - Evolution of project decisions

### Additional Context
Create additional files/folders within memory-bank/ when they help organize:
- Complex feature documentation
- Integration specifications
- API documentation
- Testing strategies
- Deployment procedures

## One-Word Commands
Quick shortcuts for common tasks:

- `$update`: Update relevant documentation, including memory-bank folder, to reflect the changes made in this session. Do not include any opinionated changes e.g. if testing is not completed, do not declare changes are production-ready. When in doubt, ask the user for clarification.
- `$commit`: Account for all the changes and implementations you made in this session and craft a concise, detailed `git commit` message. You must let the user review your commit message before submitting it.

    Execute --> Document[Document Changes]

## Documentation Updates

Memory Bank updates occur when:
1. Discovering new project patterns
2. After implementing significant changes
3. When user requests with **update memory bank** (MUST review ALL files)
4. When context needs clarification

    subgraph Process
        P1[Review ALL Files]
        P2[Document Current State]
        P3[Clarify Next Steps]
        P4[Document Insights & Patterns]

        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4
    end

    Start --> Process

Note: When triggered by **update memory bank**, I MUST review every memory bank file, even if some don't require updates. Focus particularly on activeContext.md and progress.md as they track current state.

REMEMBER: After every memory reset, I begin completely fresh. The Memory Bank is my only link to previous work. It must be maintained with precision and clarity, as my effectiveness depends entirely on its accuracy.

## Commands
- **Virtual Environment**: ALWAYS activate `.venv` before running Python commands: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate`
- **Run dev server**: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate && uvicorn app.main:app --reload`
- **Run tests**: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate && python -m pytest tests/` or `.\.venv\Scripts\activate && pytest tests/test_summary_service.py` (single test)
- **Run simulations**: `.\.venv\Scripts\activate && python tests/simulations/generate_all_chapters.py`
- **Type check**: Check imports manually (no formal type checker configured)

## Code Style & Patterns
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports (`from app.services.summary import SummaryService`)
- **Type hints**: Required for all functions, use Pydantic models extensively
- **Error handling**: Use custom exceptions (`StateNotFoundError`, `SummaryError`)
- **Async**: Use `async`/`await` for all I/O operations, services are async
- **Naming**: snake_case for functions/variables, PascalCase for classes
- **State management**: `AdventureState` is single source of truth, never hardcode chapter data
- **Logging**: Use structured logging with context (`logger.info("message", extra={"state_id": id})`)
- **Code reuse**: Review existing codebase before creating new functions, prioritize modular design

## Critical Implementation Rules

### State Management
- `AdventureState` MUST be single source of truth
- NEVER hardcode chapter numbers (use `state.story_length` and `planned_chapter_types`)
- Agency choice MUST be stored in `state.metadata["agency"]`
- Always convert chapter types to lowercase when storing/retrieving
- Complete state serialization required with proper type hints
- State changes must be logged with context

### Chapter Requirements
- First chapter MUST be STORY type with agency choice
- Last chapter MUST be CONCLUSION type
- 50% of remaining chapters MUST be LESSON type
- REFLECT chapters MUST only follow LESSON chapters
- No consecutive LESSON chapters allowed
- No question repetition in session

### Agency Implementation
- Agency MUST be referenced in all subsequent chapters
- Agency MUST evolve in REFLECT chapters
- Agency MUST have meaningful resolution in conclusion
- Use `update_agency_references()` for tracking

### Dynamic Content Handling (CRITICAL)
- **NEVER hardcode narrative strings, character names, or plot points** - content is AI-generated
- **Rely on state structure**: Base logic on `AdventureState` fields, `ChapterType`, metadata
- **Abstract testing**: Focus on state transitions, not specific LLM-generated text
- **Use metadata**: Store extracted information in structured fields, avoid parsing free-form text

### Image Generation
- Use asynchronous processing with exponential backoff (5 retries)
- Follow format: `"Colorful storybook illustration of this scene: [summary]. [Agency prefix] [name] ([details])"`
- Category-specific prefixes: companions ("accompanied by"), professions ("is a"), abilities ("has power of"), artifacts ("wielding")

### Tool Usage
- Wrap `sys.executable` in subprocess calls (not hardcoded "python")
- Implement graceful degradation for service failures
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Add verification points throughout critical paths
