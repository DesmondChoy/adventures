## Setup (For Developers)

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
    # or
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  Create a `.env` file with required environment variables:
    ```env
    # API key for LLM and image generation (both use the same key with Google)
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key
    # Or alternatively use OpenAI for LLM (image generation still requires Google)
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

    # Supabase credentials (obtain from your Supabase project)
    SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
    SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
    SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
    SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your_supabase_jwt_secret 
    # Ensure this JWT secret matches the one in your Supabase project settings (Auth > JWT Settings)
    ```
5.  Apply Supabase database migrations (if you're setting up the DB for the first time):
    ```bash
    npx supabase login
    npx supabase link --project-ref your-project-ref
    npx supabase db push
    ```
6.  Run the application:
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

*   **Backend (`app/`)**: Contains the FastAPI application, including:
    *   `models/`: Data structures like `AdventureState`.
    *   `routers/`: API and WebSocket endpoint definitions.
    *   `services/`: Core logic for LLMs, state management, content generation, Supabase interaction, etc.
    *   `static/`: Frontend assets (CSS, JS, images), including the React summary app.
    *   `templates/`: Jinja2 HTML templates.
*   **Content Sources (`app/data/`)**:
    *   `lessons/`: CSV files for educational content.
    *   `stories/`: YAML files defining story categories and narrative elements.
*   **Supabase (`supabase/`)**: Database migration files.
*   **Tests (`tests/`)**: Automated tests and simulation scripts.
*   **WIP & Memory Bank (`wip/`, `memory-bank/`)**: Documents for ongoing work and project knowledge.

## Testing

The project includes a testing framework to ensure reliability:

*   **Simulation Framework**: End-to-end testing of adventure generation.
*   **Test Coverage**: Includes chapter sequences, state transitions, and summary generation.
*   **Running Tests**:
    ```bash
    # Example: Run the complete adventure simulation
    python tests/simulations/generate_all_chapters.py
    ```

## Technical Considerations

Learning Odyssey's dynamic nature requires sequential chapter generation, as each chapter builds upon previous events and choices. The narrative is generated in real-time, following a structured arc designed for engagement. To manage this, the platform uses robust WebSocket communication, client-side and server-side (Supabase) state persistence, and graceful degradation to ensure a smooth learning journey. This thoughtful engineering ensures a reliable and engaging platform ready for future growth.
