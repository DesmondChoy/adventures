   - Every adventure is unique and choices (story paths or correct/incorrect answers) affects the narrative
   - Characters in the story encourage curiosity and learning
   - Make a pivotal agency choice in the first chapter that evolves throughout your journey
   - Story Object Method seamlessly integrates educational content into the narrative flow
   - Visual representations of agency choices through AI-generated images
   - Complete your journey with a personalized adventure summary and learning report
   - WIP: Users can upload their own settings and/or lesson topics.

2. **Technical Innovation**
   - LLM-powered dynamic storytelling with agency system and AI-generated images
   - Real-time WebSocket state management with robust error recovery and connection handling
   - Provider-agnostic AI integration supporting GPT-4o/Gemini 2.0 Flash for text and Imagen3 for image generation
   - Advanced narrative techniques (Story Object Method, phase-specific guidance, plot twist development)
   - Comprehensive state tracking with client-side persistence and metadata management
   - Dual-purpose content generation for narrative summaries and visual scenes
   - Progressive chapter summaries for complete adventure recaps

- **Architecture**: Real-time WebSocket updates, SQLite database, comprehensive error handling, and asynchronous processing
- **Frontend**: 
  - **HTML Templates**: Modular template system with component-based architecture
  - **JavaScript**: Client-side state management, WebSocket handling, and UI interactions
  - **CSS**: Modular organization, 3D carousel with animations, responsive design
  - **React**: Summary Chapter implementation with interactive educational recap
  - **Progressive Enhancement**: Content streaming with Markdown support, images loaded asynchronously
- **Text Processing**: Intelligent paragraph formatting for improved readability, word-by-word streaming with natural delays

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
   # or
   .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file with required environment variables:
   ```
   # API key for LLM and image generation (both use the same key with Google)
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key
   # Or alternatively use OpenAI for LLM (image generation still requires Google)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   ```
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key components:

  - Error handling (detection, recovery, logging)
  - Chapter summary generation and validation
  - WebSocket connection management

- **Running Tests**: 
  ```bash
  # Run the complete simulation to generate all chapters
  python tests/simulations/generate_all_chapters.py
  
  # Generate chapter summaries from a simulation state file
  python tests/simulations/generate_chapter_summaries.py
  
  # Run chapter sequence validation tests
  python tests/simulations/test_chapter_sequence_validation.py
  ```

## Technical Constraints

Learning Odyssey faces unique caching constraints due to its sequential storytelling nature. Each chapter requires the prior chapter to be complete before it can be generated, as the narrative builds upon previous events and choices. This means the entire adventure must be generated sequentially in real-time, with no ability to pre-cache future content. While theoretically possible to pre-generate all possible branches, this approach quickly becomes impractical as the adventure length and number of choices increaseâ€”each additional choice point exponentially multiplies the number of possible paths. Since each user's path through the story is unique based on their choices and educational responses, the system cannot feasibly pre-generate all potential outcomes, making traditional caching approaches ineffective.

To address these sequential generation challenges, several solutions have been implemented. Client-side state persistence using localStorage maintains the complete chapter history and user choices, ensuring continuity even during connection issues. Connection management system employs exponential backoff (1s to 30s) with automatic state restoration to maintain the narrative flow. For error recovery, it prioritizes preserving the user's progress and implement graceful degradation with fallbacks for features like image generation, ensuring the educational journey can continue even when certain components encounter issues.
