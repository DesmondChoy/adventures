# Learning Odyssey

This app aims to promote learning and curiosity by weaving together educational content and engaging narratives.

## How It Works

1. **Educational Journey**
   - Choose your setting and lesson topic
   - Every adventure is unique and choices (story paths or correct/incorrect answers) affects the narrative
   - Characters in the story encourage curiousity and learning
   - WIP: Users can upload their own settings and/or lesson topics.

2. **Technical Innovation**
   - LLM-powered dynamic storytelling
   - Real-time WebSocket state management
   - Provider-agnostic AI integration
   - Robust error recovery system
   - Client-side state persistence with localStorage
   - Connection management with exponential backoff (1s to 30s, max 5 attempts)
   - Element consistency tracking via metadata
   - Plot twist development across story phases

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Create a `.env` file with required environment variables:
   ```
   # Choose one of these API keys based on your preferred provider
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key
   ```
5. Run the application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

The project structure reflects our focus on:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular component design
- Maintainable codebase
- Scalable architecture

## Testing

### Simulation Framework

- **Story Simulation (`tests/simulations/story_simulation.py`)**:
  - Automated adventure progression with random choices
  - Comprehensive DEBUG-level logging for validation
  - Real-time WebSocket communication testing
  - Robust error handling with retry mechanisms
  - Standardized log prefixes for automated parsing:
    * `CHAPTER_TYPE:` - Logs chapter types (STORY, LESSON, CONCLUSION)
    * `CHOICE:` - Logs user choice selections
    * `LESSON:` - Logs lesson answer correctness
    * `STATS:` - Logs story completion statistics

### Test Files

- **Functionality Testing (`tests/simulations/test_simulation_functionality.py`)**:
  - Verifies chapter sequences (STORY/LESSON/CONCLUSION ordering)
  - Validates lesson ratio (approximately 50% of flexible chapters)
  - Checks lesson success rate calculations
  - Tests state transition consistency

- **Error Handling Testing (`tests/simulations/test_simulation_errors.py`)**:
  - Verifies error detection and classification
  - Tests logging level configuration
  - Validates error recovery mechanisms
  - Checks for absence of critical errors

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the complete workflow (server, simulation, tests)
python tests/simulations/run_simulation_tests.py

# Run with specific story category and lesson topic
python tests/simulations/run_simulation_tests.py --category "enchanted_forest_tales" --topic "Farm Animals"

# Skip simulation and just run tests on existing logs
python tests/simulations/run_simulation_tests.py --tests-only
```


## Technical Constraints

### Caching Constraints

The application has fundamental constraints that make traditional caching approaches ineffective:

1. **LLM-Dependent Content Generation**
   - Each chapter requires real-time LLM generation
   - Content depends on previous chapters and choices
   - Cannot pre-generate or predict next chapters
   - Must maintain server connection for content generation

2. **Dynamic Content Requirements**
   - Story progression is choice-dependent
   - Each choice affects subsequent chapter content
   - Educational content adapts to user responses
   - State must be maintained server-side

3. **State Dependencies**
   - Each new chapter depends on complete history
   - Cannot predict which path user will choose
   - Must track educational progress
   - Need to maintain narrative consistency

### Implementation Solutions

1. **State Persistence**
   - Client-side state stored in localStorage
   - Complete chapter history maintained
   - User choices preserved
   - Learning progress tracked

2. **Connection Management**
   - Exponential backoff for reconnection (1s to 30s)
   - Maximum 5 reconnection attempts
   - Automatic state restoration on reconnect
   - Silent recovery attempts

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Progress preservation during errors
   - Automatic recovery attempts
   - Clear user feedback
   - Graceful degradation
