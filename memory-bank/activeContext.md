### Recently Completed Milestones

*   **Critical Security Audit and Vulnerability Fixes (2025-05-28):**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve critical user data mixing vulnerability where authenticated users could access other users' adventures.
    *   **Problem:** Multiple security vulnerabilities allowing cross-user data access:
        *   Primary: WebSocket router incorrectly falling back to `client_uuid` searches for authenticated users
        *   Secondary: Summary endpoints lacking user ownership validation (bypassing RLS via service key)
        *   Frontend: Chapter display bugs showing incorrect progress numbers
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:**
        *   WebSocket router fell back to `client_uuid` even when user was authenticated, allowing access to other users' adventures
        *   Summary router used `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` which bypasses RLS policies without application-level validation
        *   Frontend race conditions with corrupted localStorage data overriding correct server data
    *   **Security Fixes Implemented:**
        *   **WebSocket Router (`app/routers/websocket_router.py`):**
            *   Added condition to only fall back to `client_uuid` for guest users (`not connection_data.get("user_id")`)
            *   Authenticated users now only access their own adventures via `user_id`
            *   Added security logging for blocked unauthorized access attempts
        *   **Summary Router (`app/routers/summary_router.py`):**
            *   Added `validate_user_adventure_access()` function for comprehensive user ownership validation
            *   Added `user_id` dependency injection to `/api/adventure-summary` and `/api/get-adventure-state/{state_id}` endpoints
            *   Implemented proper HTTP 403/404 error responses for unauthorized access
            *   Guest adventures remain accessible (`user_id IS NULL`) while user adventures require authentication
        *   **Frontend Display Fixes (`app/static/js/`):**
            *   Removed premature `updateProgress()` calls using corrupted localStorage data
            *   Added `chapter_update` message handler for new chapter progression
            *   Fixed race conditions between localStorage and server-provided data
    *   **Affected Files:**
        *   `app/routers/websocket_router.py` (modified - security fix)
        *   `app/routers/summary_router.py` (modified - security validation added)
        *   `app/static/js/webSocketManager.js` (modified - frontend fixes)
        *   `app/static/js/main.js` (modified - frontend fixes)
        *   `app/static/js/uiManager.js` (modified - frontend fixes)
    *   **Security Architecture Achieved:**
        *   **Application Layer:** User validation in all endpoints (WebSocket + REST)
        *   **Database Layer:** RLS policies prevent unauthorized database queries
        *   **Service Layer:** Comprehensive ownership validation despite service key usage
    *   **Result:** Complete user data isolation - authenticated users can only access their own adventures, guest functionality preserved, all cross-user access vectors eliminated.
    *   **Impact:** Critical security vulnerability eliminated, ensuring complete user privacy and data protection.

*   **Production OAuth Redirect Fix (2025-05-27):**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve critical "localhost refused to connect" errors preventing mobile users from accessing the carousel screen after Google authentication.
    *   **Problem:** After Google OAuth completion, users were redirected to localhost URLs instead of the production domain, causing connection failures on mobile devices and "loading user status..." issues.
    *   **Root Cause:** JavaScript authentication handlers used relative URLs (e.g., `/select`) which were interpreted as `localhost/select` instead of the production domain `https://learning-odyssey.up.railway.app/select` due to browser context issues after OAuth.
    *   **Tasks Completed:**
        *   Updated `redirectToSelectPage()` function in `app/templates/pages/login.html` to use absolute URLs with `window.location.origin`.
        *   Fixed all 4 redirect locations in `app/static/js/authManager.js` error handlers and logout function.
        *   Fixed both authentication success redirects in `app/static/landing/index.html`.
        *   Replaced all instances of `window.location.href = '/select'` with `window.location.href = window.location.origin + '/select'`.
    *   **Affected Files:**
        *   `app/templates/pages/login.html` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/authManager.js` (modified) 
        *   `app/static/landing/index.html` (modified)
    *   **Result:** Google OAuth now correctly redirects to production domain in all environments. Mobile users can successfully complete authentication and access the carousel screen without localhost connection errors.
    *   **Impact:** Critical production stability fix ensuring cross-environment compatibility for authentication flow.

*   **Carousel Functionality Fix (2025-05-26):**
    *   **Goal:** Restore carousel functionality that was broken after the JavaScript refactoring.
    *   **Problem:** The carousel screen where users select adventure and lesson topics was not working - clicking arrows did not rotate the carousel images.
    *   **Root Cause:** ES6 module refactoring broke carousel initialization due to missing imports, configuration overwrite, and incorrect module loading order.
    *   **Tasks Completed:**
        *   Fixed module loading order in `app/templates/components/scripts.html` to load `carousel-manager.js` before `main.js`.
        *   Added proper ES6 imports for `Carousel` and `setupCarouselKeyboardNavigation` in `main.js` and `uiManager.js`.
        *   Fixed configuration preservation by preventing `window.appConfig` overwrite in `main.js`.
        *   Added ES6 exports to `carousel-manager.js` while maintaining global availability for onclick handlers.
        *   Enhanced error handling and fallback initialization.
    *   **Affected Files:**
        *   `app/templates/components/scripts.html` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/main.js` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/uiManager.js` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/carousel-manager.js` (modified)
    *   **Result:** Carousel arrows now work correctly in both directions, allowing users to browse adventure categories and lesson topics.

*   **Client-Side JavaScript Refactoring (2025-05-26):**
    *   **Goal:** Improve modularity, maintainability, and testability of frontend JavaScript.
    *   **Tasks Completed:**
        *   Refactored the monolithic inline script in `app/templates/components/scripts.html` into multiple ES6 modules within `app/static/js/`.
        *   Created modular JavaScript files: `authManager.js`, `adventureStateManager.js`, `webSocketManager.js`, `stateManager.js`, `uiManager.js`, and `main.js`.
        *   Updated `app/templates/components/scripts.html` to load these modules and pass initial configuration data via `window.appConfig`.
        *   Established clear responsibilities for each module (authentication, local state management, WebSocket communication, UI updates, main application logic).
        *   Implemented ES6 module system with clean import/export dependencies.
    *   **Affected Files:**
        *   `app/templates/components/scripts.html` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/authManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/adventureStateManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/webSocketManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/stateManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/uiManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/main.js` (created)
    *   **Benefits:** Significantly improved code organization, maintainability, and testability of the frontend JavaScript. Reduced global namespace pollution and established clear module boundaries.

### Immediate Next Steps & Priorities

## Previous Focus: Logging Configuration Fix (2025-04-07)
*(Details of this completed task are preserved below for historical context but are no longer the active focus.)*

We fixed a logging configuration issue in `app/utils/logging_config.py` that caused both a `TypeError` on startup and potential `UnicodeEncodeError` during runtime on Windows.

### Problem Addressed
1.  **`TypeError` on Startup:** The `logging.StreamHandler` was incorrectly initialized with an `encoding="utf-8"` argument, which it does not accept.
2.  **`UnicodeEncodeError` during Runtime:** The default Windows console encoding (`cp1252`) could not handle certain Unicode characters, causing errors when logging messages containing them.

### Implemented Solution
1.  **Removed Invalid Argument:** Removed the `encoding="utf-8"` argument from the `logging.StreamHandler` initialization.
2.  **Wrapped `sys.stdout`:** Wrapped the standard output stream (`sys.stdout.buffer`) using `io.TextIOWrapper` configured with `encoding='utf-8'` and `errors='replace'`.
3.  **Added Basic Console Formatter:** Added a simple `logging.Formatter('%(message)s')` to the console handler.
4.  **Ensured File Handler Encoding:** Explicitly set `encoding='utf-8'` for the `logging.FileHandler`.
5.  **Added JSON File Formatter:** Added a basic JSON formatter to the file handler.

### Result
The application now starts without the `TypeError`, and console logging correctly handles Unicode characters.

### Affected Files
1.  `app/utils/logging_config.py`: Updated `setup_logging` function.
