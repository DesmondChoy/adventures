# Active Context

## Architecture and Implementation

The project is focused on implementing core Learning Odyssey features, including:

1.  **Adventure Flow Implementation:**
    *   Landing page topic and length selection (`app/routers/web.py`).
    *   ChapterType determination (LESSON/STORY/CONCLUSION) in `app/services/chapter_manager.py`.
    *   Content source integration in `app/services/llm/prompt_engineering.py`:
        *   LESSON chapters: `lessons.csv` + LLM narrative wrapper.
        *   STORY chapters: Full LLM generation with choices.
        *   CONCLUSION chapters: Full LLM generation without choices.
    *   Narrative continuity via prompt engineering.

2.  **Content Management (`app/data/`):**
    *   `lessons.csv` integration for LESSON chapters.
    *   `stories.yaml` templates for STORY chapters.
    *   LLM response validation.
    *   History tracking in `AdventureState`.

3.  **Chapter Sequencing (`app/services/chapter_manager.py`):**
    *   First two chapters: Always STORY.
    *   Second-to-last chapter: Always STORY.
    *   Last chapter: Always CONCLUSION.
    *   50% of remaining chapters: LESSON (subject to available questions).

4.  **Testing Strategy (`tests/simulations/`):**
    *   Story simulation framework.
    *   Response validation.
    *   State verification.
    *   Error handling coverage.

5. **User Experience (`app/routers/web.py`):**
    * Topic selection interface.
    * Adventure length selection.
    * Real-time feedback system.
    * WebSocket state updates.
    * Progress tracking visualization

## Recent Changes

   - Enhanced logging for story initialization

3. Prompt Engineering Improvements:
   - Enhanced system prompt with new elements
   - Implemented phase-based plot twist progression:
     * Rising: Subtle introduction
     * Trials: Gradual build-up
     * Climax: Full revelation
   - Added sensory details integration
   - Updated phase guidance

4. State Management Updates:
   - Modified AdventureState to track new elements

   - Enhanced validation for required categories
   - Improved error handling and logging

5. WebSocket Handling:
   - Updated websocket_router.py for new elements
   - Enhanced state initialization and validation
   - Improved error handling and connection management
   - Added comprehensive logging

6. UI Updates:
   - Modified story category dropdown to use display names
   - Updated story selection interface
   - Enhanced error messaging
   - Improved state synchronization

### Previous Updates
- Modularized JavaScript code into logical sections:
  * Utility functions (loaders, progress tracking)
  * WebSocket handling (initialization, message processing)
  * UI updates (story text, choices, stats display)
  * State management (placeholder for future expansion)
  * Event handlers (form submission, choice selection)
- Enhanced WebSocket handling:
  * Centralized connection management
  * Improved error handling and messaging
  * Better state synchronization
  * Proper cleanup on page unload
- Improved UI updates and interaction:
  * Cleaner text processing with HTML entity decoding
  * Smoother choice button transitions
  * Better progress tracking visualization
  * Enhanced stats display for journey completion
- Added comprehensive code comments and documentation

### State Management (`app/models/story.py`)
- Enhanced state tracking system.
- Added `planned_chapter_types` to `AdventureState`.

### WebSocket Architecture Refactoring
- Split WebSocket handling into `app/routers/websocket_router.py` and `app/services/websocket_service.py`.

### Chapter Management (`app/services/chapter_manager.py`)
- Enhanced state initialization.

### State Management (`app/services/adventure_state_manager.py`)
- Created `AdventureStateManager` class.
- Implemented methods for initializing, retrieving, updating, and appending to state.
- Refactored state management logic from `websocket.py`.

### Prompt Engineering (`app/services/llm/prompt_engineering.py`)
- Enhanced world-building system.
- Improved narrative continuity.
- Simplified `process_consequences()`.

### Story Length Fixes
- Updated `index.html` and `app/models/story.py` for story lengths of 5, 8, and 10 chapters.

### Chapter 1 Choices Fix
- Removed the `is_opening` special case in `app/services/llm/prompt_engineering.py`.

### "Chapter X:" Prefix Fix
- Added an instruction to the system prompt and improved the regex in `app/services/websocket_service.py` to prevent chapter prefixes.
- Fixed duplicate parameter and docstring issues in  `app/services/websocket_service.py`.

## Current Considerations

### Testing Framework (`tests/simulations/story_simulation.py`)
- Primary purpose:
  * Generate test data through random adventure progression
  * Provide comprehensive logs for test validation
  * Support testing requirements when core components change
- Current status:
  * Successfully generates required DEBUG level logs
  * Captures all state changes and responses
  * Maintains WebSocket communication
  * Implements robust error handling
  * Functions as intended for test data generation
