# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is implementing core Learning Odyssey features:

1. Adventure Flow Implementation (`app/services/chapter_manager.py`)
   - Landing page topic and length selection
   - ChapterType determination (LESSON/STORY)
   - Content source integration:
     - LESSON chapters: lessons.csv + LLM narrative wrapper
     - STORY chapters: Full LLM generation
   - Narrative continuity via prompt engineering

2. Content Management (`app/data/`)
   - lessons.csv integration for LESSON chapters
   - stories.yaml templates for STORY chapters
   - LLM response validation
   - History tracking in AdventureState

## Recent Changes

### State Management (`app/models/story.py`)
- Enhanced state tracking system:
  * Sequential progression via chapter_number
  * Navigation paths via current_chapter_id
  * Clear separation of concerns:
    - ChapterManager uses chapter_number
    - WebSocket router uses current_chapter_id
  * Improved state serialization
  * Better error recovery

- Added planned_chapter_types to AdventureState:
  * Pre-determined sequence of chapter types
  * Stored during state initialization
  * Single source of truth for chapter progression
  * Maintains complete state serialization

- Current focus areas:
  * State synchronization optimization
  * Navigation path validation
  * Error recovery improvements
  * Client-server state consistency

### Chapter Management (`app/services/chapter_manager.py`)
- Enhanced state initialization:
  * Store chapter type sequence in AdventureState
  * Maintain sequence through entire adventure
  * Improved state consistency
  * Better error handling

### Prompt Engineering (`app/services/llm/prompt_engineering.py`)
- Enhanced world-building system:
  * Uses topic/subtopic for thematic world creation
  * Improved data structures in LessonQuestion
  * Better narrative coherence through subject connections
  * More meaningful fantasy world generation
- Improved narrative continuity:
  * Use planned_chapter_types for accurate chapter type info
  * Removed hard-coded chapter type assumptions
  * Enhanced state-driven progression
  * Better state consistency in prompts
- Simplified process_consequences():
  * Removed hardcoded chapter number checks
  * Logic now based purely on is_correct state
  * Maintains high-quality narrative guidance
  * Follows state-driven pattern

## Active Decisions

### Architecture
1. Content Flow (`app/services/chapter_manager.py`)
   - LESSON chapters:
     * Questions from lessons.csv
     * LLM narrative wrapper
     * Response validation
   - STORY chapters:
     * Full LLM generation
     * Three choices per chapter
   - Outcome tracking in AdventureState
   - Narrative continuity via prompts

2. Testing Strategy (`tests/simulations/`)
   - Story simulation framework
   - Response validation
   - State verification
   - Error handling coverage

### Implementation
1. User Experience (`app/routers/web.py`)
   - Topic selection interface
   - Adventure length selection
   - Real-time feedback system
   - WebSocket state updates

2. Flow Control (`app/services/chapter_manager.py`)
   - LESSON type enforcement for first/last chapters
   - MAX_LESSON_RATIO (40%) for middle chapters
   - Dynamic content sampling
   - Error recovery mechanisms

## Current Considerations

### Testing Framework (`tests/simulations/story_simulation.py`)
- Primary purpose:
  * Generate test data through random adventure progression
  * Provide comprehensive logs for test validation
  * Support testing requirements when core components change
- Current status:
  * Successfully generates required DEBUG level logs
  * Captures all state changes and responses
  * Maintains WebSocket communication
  * Implements robust error handling
  * Functions as intended for test data generation
