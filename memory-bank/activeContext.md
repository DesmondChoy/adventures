# Active Context

## Enhanced Typewriter Summary with Handwriting Animation (2025-03-19)

1. **Implemented Two-Stage Experience for Summary Chapter:**
   * Problem: The original implementation showed both the congratulatory message and chapter summaries on the same page, creating a cluttered experience
   * Solution:
     - Implemented a two-stage approach:
       * First stage: Shows only the "Adventure Complete" notification with stars animation
       * Second stage: Shows only the chapter summaries after clicking a button
     - Added smooth transitions between the two stages
   * Implementation Details:
     - Created separate container divs for each stage
     - Added a "View Your Adventure Summary" button that appears after the stars animation
     - Implemented fade animations for transitioning between views
   * Benefits:
     - Cleaner, more focused user experience
     - Better separation of concerns between celebration and content review
     - More dramatic reveal of the adventure summary

2. **Enhanced Animation with Handwriting Effect:**

     - Implemented character-by-character animation with randomized properties
   * Implementation Details:
     - Added the Caveat font via Google Fonts
     - Created a span for each character with randomized rotation
     - Added special styling for punctuation (bolder, darker)
     - Implemented subtle movement effects that mimic handwriting
   * Benefits:
     - More visually engaging animation
     - Better mimics the feeling of handwritten notes
     - Creates a more personal, organic feel to the summaries

     - Better overall user experience

## Updated Chapter Summary Generator for Simulation State JSON Files (2025-03-19)

1. **Updated generate_chapter_summaries.py to Work with Simulation State JSON Files:**
   * Problem: The script was designed to extract chapter content from log files, but now we have simulation state JSON files from the consolidated generate_all_chapters.py script
   * Solution:
     - Modified the script to accept simulation state JSON files instead of log files
     - Updated the chapter content extraction to navigate the JSON structure
     - Added a delay mechanism to prevent API timeouts and connection issues
   * Implementation Details:
     - Updated `load_chapter_content` function to extract chapter content directly from the JSON structure
     - Renamed `find_latest_simulation_log` to `find_latest_simulation_state` to find the latest simulation state JSON file
     - Added a configurable delay parameter with a default of 2.0 seconds between chapter processing
     - Added a command-line argument `--delay` to customize the delay
     - Updated documentation and examples to reflect the new features
   * Benefits:
     - Script now works with the new JSON file format produced by generate_all_chapters.py
     - More reliable operation with the delay mechanism preventing API overload
     - Consistent chapter summary generation for all 10 chapters
     - Better error handling and recovery from API timeouts

## Consolidated Simulation Scripts and Renamed chapter_generator.py (2025-03-19)

1. **Consolidated Simulation Scripts:**
   * Problem: Multiple simulation scripts with overlapping functionality were causing confusion and maintenance issues
   * Solution:
     - Removed redundant simulation scripts:
       * `story_simulation.py`: Replaced by the enhanced chapter_generator.py
       * `generate_all_chapters.py` (old version): Functionality merged into chapter_generator.py
       * `run_chapter_generator.py`: Simple wrapper script no longer needed
       * `batch_generate_chapters.py`: Specialized batch script no longer necessary
     - Renamed `chapter_generator.py` to `generate_all_chapters.py` for consistency
     - Renamed `CHAPTER_GENERATOR_README.md` to `GENERATE_ALL_CHAPTERS.md`
     - Updated documentation to reflect the consolidated approach
   * Implementation Details:
     - Updated file paths and references in the script
     - Changed log filename pattern to match the new script name
     - Updated logger name from "chapter_generator" to "generate_all_chapters"
     - Updated header text in log files
   * Benefits:
     - Simplified codebase with fewer redundant files
     - Clearer naming convention for simulation scripts
     - Improved maintainability with consolidated functionality
     - Reduced confusion for developers working with simulation tools

## Fixed Chapter Generator Script for Simulation State Validation (2025-03-18)

1. **Fixed SimulationState Class in chapter_generator.py:**
   * Problem: The script was failing with `ValueError: "SimulationState" object has no field "simulation_metadata"` because AdventureState (which SimulationState extends) is a Pydantic model that doesn't allow adding arbitrary fields.
   * Solution:
     - Properly defined the simulation_metadata field using Pydantic's Field:
       ```python
       simulation_metadata: Dict[str, Any] = Field(
           default_factory=dict, description="Metadata specific to the simulation run"
       )
       ```
     - Modified the __init__ method to initialize the field properly:
       ```python
       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
           # Initialize with default values
           if "simulation_metadata" not in kwargs:
               kwargs["simulation_metadata"] = {
                   "run_id": run_id,
                   "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
                   "random_choices": [],
               }
           super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
       ```
     - Updated the save_to_file method to handle the simulation_metadata field correctly
   * Implementation Details:
     - Added import for Pydantic's Field
     - Added proper type hints for the simulation_metadata field
     - Added null checking in the record_choice method
     - Removed redundant code in the save_to_file method
   * Benefits:
     - Script now runs without validation errors
     - Properly integrates with Pydantic's validation system
     - Maintains the same functionality while following proper OOP principles
     - Provides better type hints for IDE support

2. **Fixed WebSocketClientProtocol Deprecation Warnings:**
   * Problem: The script was generating deprecation warnings for WebSocketClientProtocol
   * Solution:
     - Updated imports to use websockets.client
     - Updated type hints to use websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol
   * Implementation Details:
     - Changed import from `import websockets` to `import websockets.client`
     - Updated all function signatures to use the new type:
       ```python
       async def establish_websocket_connection(
           uri: str, retry_count: int = 0
       ) -> Optional[websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol]:
       ```
       ```python
       async def send_message(
           ws: websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol, message: Dict[str, Any]
       ) -> None:
       ```
       ```python
       async def process_chapter(
           websocket: websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol,
           chapter_number: int,
           is_conclusion: bool = False,
       ) -> Tuple[str, List[Dict[str, Any]]]:
       ```
       ```python
       async def process_summary(websocket: websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol) -> str:
       ```
   * Benefits:
     - Eliminates deprecation warnings
     - Future-proofs the code against API changes
     - Follows best practices for the websockets library

## New Chapter Summary Generator Script (2025-03-17)

1. **Created Standalone Chapter Summary Generator Script:**
   * Problem: Needed a way to generate consistent chapter summaries for all chapters, including Chapter 10 (CONCLUSION)
   * Solution:
     - Created `tests/simulations/generate_chapter_summaries.py` script that:
       * Extracts chapter content from simulation log files
       * Generates summaries using the same prompt template for all chapters
       * Uses the same function to generate summaries for all chapters (no special cases)
       * Handles missing chapters gracefully by continuing to process available chapters
   * Implementation Details:
     - Uses direct API call to Gemini with fallback to streaming approach
     - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff for reliability
     - Provides both standard and compact output formats
     - Supports skipping JSON file creation with `--no-json` flag
     - Includes detailed error handling and logging
   * Benefits:
     - Consistent summary generation for all chapters, including CONCLUSION
     - Robust error handling that continues processing even if some chapters are missing
     - Flexible output options for different use cases
     - Reliable summary generation with retry logic

## Ongoing Issue: Chapter 10 Content Not Being Captured in Simulation Log (2025-03-18)

1. **Issue with Chapter 10 Content in generate_all_chapters.py:**
   * Problem: Chapter 10 content is visible in the terminal but not being captured in the simulation log file.
   * Current Status:
     - Created `generate_all_chapters.py` script to focus solely on generating all 10 chapters
     - Modified the script to continue processing WebSocket messages after receiving the "story_complete" event
     - Added special handling for timeouts and connection closed events when processing the conclusion chapter
     - Added a new event type `EVENT:CONCLUSION_CHAPTER` to log the conclusion chapter content
   * Observed Behavior:
     - The script successfully processes chapters 1-9
     - It logs "Chapter 10 content complete (3006 chars)" in the terminal
     - It logs "EVENT:STORY_COMPLETE" in the log file
     - It logs "Waiting for conclusion chapter content..." in the log file
     - But then it times out waiting for a response: "Timeout waiting for response in chapter 10"
   * Next Steps:
     - Investigate why the WebSocket connection is being closed or timing out before Chapter 10 content can be fully processed
     - Consider increasing the timeout value for the conclusion chapter
     - Add more detailed logging to track the WebSocket connection state
     - Explore alternative approaches to capture the conclusion chapter content

## Ongoing Issue: Chapter 10 Summary Not Showing in Adventure Summary (2025-03-17)

1. **Partial Fix for WebSocket Connection Closure Issue:**
   * Problem: Chapter 10's summary is still not showing up properly in the adventure summary. The connection now stays open, but we're still seeing a placeholder summary instead of the actual content.
   * Current Status:
     - Modified `websocket_router.py` to keep the connection open after the CONCLUSION chapter
     - Changed the `break` statement to `continue` in the `is_story_complete` condition
     - Added enhanced logging in WebSocket service
     - Increased timeout for summary processing
   * Remaining Issue:
     - Despite these changes, we're still seeing a generic placeholder for Chapter 10:
     ```
     ### Chapter 10 (Conclusion)
     In the conclusion chapter, the adventure reached its resolution. The protagonist faced the final challenge and completed their journey, bringing closure to the story and reflecting on the lessons learned along the way.
     ```
     - This is the default placeholder text, not an actual summary generated from the chapter content
   * Next Steps:
     - Further investigate why the Chapter 10 summary isn't being properly generated or captured
     - Check if the summary generation is happening but not being stored correctly
     - Verify if the CONCLUSION chapter summary is being generated with the correct parameters
     - Ensure the summary is being properly included in the final state

2. **Enhanced Logging in WebSocket Service:**
   * Implementation Details:
     - Added logs for current state: `logger.info(f"Current state has {len(state.chapters)} chapters")`
     - Added logs for chapter summaries: `logger.info(f"Current chapter summaries: {len(state.chapter_summaries)}")`
     - Added logs for CONCLUSION chapter: `logger.info(f"Found CONCLUSION chapter: {conclusion_chapter.chapter_number}")`
     - Added logs for summary generation: `logger.info(f"Generated CONCLUSION chapter summary: {chapter_summary[:100]}...")`
   * Benefits:
     - Better visibility into the summary generation process
     - Easier debugging of issues with chapter summaries
     - More detailed error information when problems occur

3. **Increased Timeout for Summary Processing:**
   * Implementation Details:
     ```python
     # Added new constant
     SUMMARY_TIMEOUT = 120  # seconds specifically for summary operations
     
     # Used longer timeout for summary response
     response_raw = await asyncio.wait_for(
         websocket.recv(), timeout=SUMMARY_TIMEOUT
     )
     ```
   * Benefits:
     - Prevents timeouts during summary generation
     - Allows for more complex summary processing
     - Improves reliability of the simulation tests

## Refactored Story Simulation for Improved Maintainability (2025-03-17)

1. **Refactored `story_simulation.py` for Better Maintainability:**
   * Problem: The story simulation code had duplicate sections, inconsistent chapter summary logging, and complex nested logic
   * Solution:
     - Created dedicated helper functions for common operations
     - Standardized chapter summary logging with a single function
     - Consolidated verification steps for chapter summaries
     - Added specific error types for better error handling
   * Implementation Details:
     - Created `log_chapter_summary` function to standardize all chapter summary logging
     - Implemented `verify_chapter_summaries` function to check for missed summaries
     - Added `establish_websocket_connection` function with proper retry logic
     - Created `send_message` function for consistent WebSocket message sending
     - Added specific error types: `WebSocketConnectionError`, `ResponseTimeoutError`, `ResponseParsingError`
   * Benefits:
     - Improved maintainability with more modular code
     - Better debugging with source tracking for chapter summaries
     - Reduced code duplication for common operations
     - More consistent approach to chapter summary handling
     - Enhanced error handling with specific error types

## Standardized Chapter Summary Logging and Extraction (2025-03-16)

1. **Standardized Chapter Summary Logging in `story_simulation.py`:**
   * Problem: Chapter summaries were logged inconsistently, with the conclusion chapter (Chapter 10) using a different format than regular chapters
   * Solution:
     - Standardized all chapter summary logging to use the `EVENT:CHAPTER_SUMMARY` format
     - Implemented consistent debug logging with `"Chapter {chapter_number} summary: {content}"` format
     - Added verification steps to ensure all chapter summaries are properly logged
     - Added multiple fallback mechanisms to retroactively log any missed summaries
   * Implementation Details:
     - Modified the `summary_complete` handler to explicitly log all chapter summaries with `EVENT:CHAPTER_SUMMARY`
     - Added a verification step that checks for any missing chapter summaries
     - Added a final verification at the end of simulation to catch any remaining unlogged summaries
     - Standardized debug logging format for all chapters including the conclusion
   * Benefits:
     - Consistent logging format for all chapters (1-10) makes debugging easier
     - Multiple verification steps ensure no chapter summaries are missed
     - Improved reliability for testing and analysis tools that depend on log data
     - Better maintainability with standardized logging patterns

2. **Enhanced Chapter Summary Extraction in `show_summary_from_log.py`:**
   * Problem: The extraction script wasn't reliably finding Chapter 10 summaries due to inconsistent logging formats
   * Solution:
     - Prioritized `EVENT:CHAPTER_SUMMARY` as the primary standardized format
     - Implemented a fallback hierarchy with clear source tracking
     - Added support for both old and new logging formats
     - Added tracking of which chapters have been found to avoid duplicates
   * Implementation Details:
     - Added tracking of found chapters using a `found_chapters` set
     - Implemented a prioritized extraction approach:
       1. First try `EVENT:CHAPTER_SUMMARY` (primary standardized format)
       2. Then try `STORY_COMPLETE` event (fallback)
       3. Then try `FINAL_CHAPTER_SUMMARIES` event (fallback)
       4. Finally try direct content extraction (last resort fallback)
     - Added clear logging to show which source each chapter summary came from
     - Added support for both old "Final chapter content" and new "Chapter X summary" formats
   * Benefits:
     - More reliable extraction of all chapter summaries, including Chapter 10
     - Clear visibility into which source each summary came from
     - Backward compatibility with existing log files
     - Prioritization of the standardized format for better consistency

## Updated Story Simulation for Complete Chapter Summaries (2025-03-16)

1. **Enhanced Story Simulation for CONCLUSION Chapter Summary:**
   * Problem: The simulation was ending prematurely after the CONCLUSION chapter, before the CONCLUSION chapter summary could be generated
   * Solution:
     - Modified the "story_complete" handler to send a "reveal_summary" choice instead of immediately returning
     - Added handlers for "summary_start" and "summary_complete" message types
     - Enhanced logging for SUMMARY chapter content and events
     - Added "EVENT:FINAL_CHAPTER_SUMMARIES" log entry for the complete set of summaries
   * Implementation Details:
     - After receiving the "story_complete" message, the simulation now sends a "reveal_summary" choice
     - This simulates the user clicking the "Reveal Your Adventure Summary" button
     - The simulation then processes the SUMMARY chapter and captures all 10 chapter summaries
     - New log events track the summary generation process
   * Benefits:
     - All 10 chapter summaries (including CONCLUSION) are now captured in the simulation log
     - The simulation accurately reflects the complete user journey through the application
     - Provides comprehensive test data for verifying the chapter summary functionality
     - Ensures the SUMMARY chapter is properly tested in automated simulations

## Improved CONCLUSION Chapter Summary Generation (2025-03-16)

1. **Consistent Chapter Summary Generation for All Chapters:**
   * Problem: The CONCLUSION chapter didn't have a chapter summary to be used in the SUMMARY chapter
   * Solution:
     - Modified the client-side code in `index.html` to send a choice message with ID "reveal_summary" instead of a "request_summary" message
     - Enhanced `process_choice()` in `websocket_service.py` to handle this special choice ID and generate a summary for the CONCLUSION chapter
     - Removed the special handling for "request_summary" messages in `websocket_router.py`
     - Removed the `process_summary_request()` function from `websocket_service.py`
   * Implementation Details:
     - When the "Reveal Your Adventure Summary" button is clicked, it now sends a choice with ID "reveal_summary"
     - This choice is processed by `process_choice()` which generates a summary for the CONCLUSION chapter using `chapter_manager.generate_chapter_summary()`
     - The summary is stored in `state.chapter_summaries` just like all other chapter summaries
     - The SUMMARY chapter is then created and displayed with all chapter summaries, including the CONCLUSION chapter
   * Benefits:
     - Consistent chapter summary generation for all chapters, including the CONCLUSION chapter
     - Complete adventure recap in the SUMMARY chapter
     - Simplified architecture with a single code path for all chapter summaries
     - Improved maintainability with less special-case handling

## Enhanced Chapter Summary Generation with Educational Context (2025-03-16)

1. **Completely Redesigned SUMMARY_CHAPTER_PROMPT Template:**
   * Problem: Previous chapter summaries lacked educational context and didn't emphasize the choices made
   * Solution:
     - Implemented a completely redesigned SUMMARY_CHAPTER_PROMPT with a more structured format:
     ```python
     SUMMARY_CHAPTER_PROMPT = """
     This is one chapter from a Choose Your Own Adventure story. At the end of each chapter, the user is presented with choices.
     Combine CHAPTER CONTENT and CHOICE MADE to create a natural, organic and concise summary (70-100 words) of that captures the key narrative events and character development.

     The summary should be written in third person, past tense, and maintain the adventure's narrative tone. 
     If there are educational questions relating to CHOICE MADE, quote the entire question without paraphrasing it. 
     This summary will be used together with future chapter summaries as a recap to the whole adventure spanning multiple chapters.

     # CHAPTER CONTENT
     {chapter_content}

     # CHOICE MADE
     "{chosen_choice}" - {choice_context}

     # CHAPTER SUMMARY
     """
     ```
     - Increased summary length from 30-40 words to 70-100 words for more comprehensive recaps
     - Added explicit instructions to quote educational questions verbatim
     - Added clear section headings for better prompt organization

2. **Added Choice Context for Educational Feedback:**
   * Implementation Details:
     - Added `choice_context` parameter to `generate_chapter_summary` method in `chapter_manager.py`
     - Updated `process_choice` function in `websocket_service.py` to construct appropriate context:
       * For LESSON chapters: " (Correct answer)" or " (Incorrect answer)" based on response
       * For STORY chapters: No additional context (empty string)
     - Added error handling to ensure the main flow continues even if summary generation fails

3. **Enhanced Debugging for Chapter Summary Generation:**
   * Added comprehensive debug logging in `generate_chapter_summary` method:
     ```python
     logger.debug(f"\n=== DEBUG: Full SUMMARY_CHAPTER_PROMPT sent to LLM ===\n{custom_prompt}\n===================================\n")
     ```
   * This allows developers to see the exact prompt sent to the LLM, including all substituted values

4. **Benefits of the New Implementation:**
   * More detailed and comprehensive chapter summaries (70-100 words vs. 30-40 words)
   * Educational content is preserved with verbatim question quoting
   * Feedback on correct/incorrect answers is included for educational chapters
   * Improved narrative flow with better context from choices made
   * Extensible design that can accommodate future chapter types
   * Easier debugging with comprehensive logging

## Improved Learning Report Display in Simulation Log Summary (2025-03-16)

1. **Enhanced Learning Report Display in Simulation Log Summary Viewer:**
   * Problem: The learning report in `show_summary_from_log.py` was showing redundant information for correctly answered questions
   * Solution:
     - Modified the learning report generation in `show_summary_from_log.py` to:
       * Always show "Your Answer" with a "(Correct)" or "(Incorrect)" indicator
       * Only show "Correct Answer" when the user's answer was incorrect
       * Always show the explanation regardless of correctness
     - Added code to handle cases where the Learning Report section isn't found in the summary content
     - Ensured the thank you message is preserved at the end of the report
   * Result:
     - More streamlined learning report that avoids redundancy
     - For correct answers: Shows only "Your Answer: [answer] (Correct)" followed by the explanation
     - For incorrect answers: Shows both "Your Answer: [answer] (Incorrect)" and "Correct Answer: [correct_answer]" followed by the explanation
     - Clearer educational feedback for users
     - Consistent display of explanations for all questions

## Separated Image Scene Generation from Chapter Summaries (2025-03-15)

1. **Implemented Dedicated Image Scene Generation:**
   * Problem: The application was using chapter summaries for both narrative recaps and image generation, creating a compromise between two different needs
   * Solution:
     - **Added New Template in `prompt_templates.py`:**
       * Created `IMAGE_SCENE_PROMPT` specifically for extracting the most visually compelling moment from a chapter:
       ```python
       IMAGE_SCENE_PROMPT = """Identify the single most visually striking moment from this chapter that would make a compelling illustration. 

       Focus on:
       1. A specific dramatic action or emotional peak
       2. Clear visual elements (character poses, expressions, environmental details)
       3. The moment with the most visual energy or emotional impact
       4. Elements that best represent the chapter's theme or turning point

       Describe ONLY this scene in 20-30 words using vivid, specific language. Focus purely on the visual elements and action, not narrative explanation. Do not include character names or story title.

       CHAPTER CONTENT:
       {chapter_content}

       SCENE DESCRIPTION:
       """
       ```
     - **Added New Method in `ChapterManager`:**
       * Created `generate_image_scene` method that uses the new prompt to extract the most visually striking moment
       * Implemented similar structure to `generate_chapter_summary` but with different focus
       * Added robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
     - **Updated WebSocket Service:**
       * Modified `stream_and_send_chapter` to use `generate_image_scene` instead of `generate_chapter_summary` for image generation
       * Kept the same `enhance_prompt` mechanism to add agency, story, and visual details
   * Result:
     - Chapter summaries now focus on comprehensive narrative overviews (better for SUMMARY chapter)
     - Image generation now focuses on the most visually compelling moments (better for illustrations)
     - More dynamic, exciting illustrations that capture specific dramatic moments
     - Clearer separation of concerns between the two different needs

## Removed Chapter Summary Truncation for Complete Summaries (2025-03-15)

1. **Removed Chapter Summary Truncation:**
   * Problem: Chapter summaries were being artificially truncated to 40 words when they exceeded 50 words, causing incomplete summaries ending with "..."
   * Solution:
     - Removed the truncation logic from the `generate_chapter_summary` method
     - Maintained the LLM prompt that still guides it to generate concise summaries
     - Kept the empty summary check and fallback mechanism
   * Result:
     - Chapter summaries are now displayed in full as generated by the LLM
     - No more truncated summaries ending with "..."
     - More complete and informative chapter summaries throughout the application
     - Better context in the summary chapter where these summaries are displayed

## Fixed Simulation Log Summary Extraction for Complete Chapter Summaries (2025-03-15)

1. **Fixed Chapter Summary Extraction from Simulation Logs:**
   * Problem: The `show_summary_from_log.py` script wasn't extracting all chapter summaries from simulation logs, resulting in dummy summaries for chapters 9-10
   * Solution:
     - **Enhanced `extract_chapter_summaries_from_log` in `debug_summary_chapter.py`:**
       * Added code to extract summaries from the STORY_COMPLETE event
       * Fixed logger variable scope issues for proper error handling
       * Added detailed logging to track where summaries are found
     - **Enhanced `show_summary_from_log.py` script:**
       * Added code to extract chapter summaries from the STORY_COMPLETE event
       * Added code to extract chapter 10 content from the "Final chapter content" message
       * Implemented summary generation for chapter 10 using the first few sentences
       * Improved mapping of summaries to their respective chapter numbers
   * Result:
     - The script now correctly extracts all chapter summaries from simulation logs
     - No more dummy summaries for chapters 9-10
     - Complete summary chapter with all 10 chapters and educational questions
     - Better understanding of the story simulation structure for future development

## Improved Chapter Summaries with Narrative Focus (2025-03-14)

1. **Enhanced Chapter Summary Generation:**
   * Problem: Chapter summaries were optimized for image generation (visual scenes) rather than narrative progression, making the SUMMARY chapter less cohesive and educational
   * Solution:

       * Maintained the same LLM service call structure for compatibility
   * Result:
     - Chapter summaries now capture key story events and character development
     - Summaries include important choices and educational content when present
     - Consistent third-person, past tense voice throughout all summaries
     - The SUMMARY chapter provides a more cohesive and educational recap of the adventure

## Enhanced Simulation Log Summary Viewer with Educational Questions (2025-03-14)

1. **Enhanced Simulation Log Summary Viewer:**
   * Problem: The `show_summary_from_log.py` script was not extracting chapter summaries from simulation logs and was showing dummy summaries instead. Additionally, educational questions encountered during the adventure were not being displayed in the Learning Report section.
   * Solution:
     - **Enhanced Chapter Summary Extraction:**
       * Modified `extract_chapter_summaries_from_log` to extract chapter content from STATE_TRANSITION events
       * Added support for different content formats (direct content field and chapter_content.content)
       * Implemented fallback to use the first paragraph of chapter content as a summary
     - **Added Lesson Question Extraction:**
       * Updated `extract_chapter_summaries_from_log` to extract educational questions from EVENT:LESSON_QUESTION entries
       * Added a `lesson_questions` field to the AdventureState model to store the questions
       * Enhanced the summary display to show questions, topics, and correct answers
     - **Improved Summary Display:**
       * Added handling for cases with fewer than 10 summaries by adding dummy summaries for missing chapters
       * Replaced the default "You didn't encounter any educational questions" message with actual questions
       * Formatted the Learning Report section to display educational content
   * Result:
     - The script now correctly extracts chapter summaries from simulation logs
     - Educational questions are displayed in the Learning Report section
     - The summary provides a complete overview of the adventure, including both narrative and educational content

2. **Fixed SUMMARY Chapter Functionality:**
   * Problem: After clicking the "Reveal Your Adventure Summary" button at the end of a 10-chapter adventure, the application showed a loading spinner but never actually loaded the summary page.
   * Solution:
     - **Backend Fix in `websocket_service.py`**:
       * Modified the `process_summary_request` function to properly receive and update the state from the client
       * Added code to get the client's state from the request and update the state manager
       * Improved error handling to provide better feedback when issues occur
     - **Frontend Fix in `index.html`**:
       * Enhanced the `requestSummary` function with better error handling and a timeout
       * Added code to clear content and reset state before sending the request
       * Implemented a 10-second timeout to detect if the request is hanging
       * Added better error messaging for users
   * Result:
     - The "Reveal Your Adventure Summary" button now works correctly
     - Users can see the summary page after completing an adventure
     - Better error handling and user feedback if issues occur

## Updated Story Simulation for Chapter Summaries Support (2025-03-11)

1. **Enhanced Story Simulation for Chapter Summaries Testing:**
   * Purpose: Update the story simulation to support the new chapter summaries approach
   * Implementation Details:
     - Updated initial state structure to include the `chapter_summaries` field
     - Added detection and logging of chapter summaries as they're received from the server
     - Implemented structured logging for chapter summary events with "EVENT:CHAPTER_SUMMARY" prefix
     - Added a comprehensive log at the end of simulation with all chapter summaries
     - Enhanced human-readable output with chapter summary display
   * Benefits:
     - Enables testing of the SUMMARY chapter functionality without manually going through all 10 chapters
     - Provides structured data for automated testing of the chapter summaries feature
     - Captures chapter summaries in a format that can be easily extracted and analyzed
     - Maintains alignment with how chapter summaries are implemented in the actual application

## Enhanced Summary Implementation with Progressive Chapter Summaries (2025-03-11)

1. **Enhanced Summary Implementation:**
   * Purpose: Improve the SUMMARY chapter by generating and storing chapter summaries throughout the adventure
   * Implementation Completed:
     - **Backend Model Updates**
       * Added `chapter_summaries` field to the AdventureState model to store summaries
       * Maintained compatibility with existing SUMMARY chapter type
     
     - **Backend Services Implementation**
       * Modified `process_choice` function to generate chapter summaries after each choice
       * Completely rewrote `generate_summary_content` function to use stored summaries
       * Maintained the existing `process_summary_request` function
       * Added error handling to ensure the main flow continues even if summary generation fails
     
     - **Integration with Existing Systems**
       * Leveraged the existing `generate_chapter_summary` method from ImageGenerationService
       * Reused the same summary generation logic that's already used for image prompts
       * Added fallback to the original LLM-based summary generation if no summaries are available
   
   * Design Principles Applied:
     - Maintained consistent visual theming with the existing app
     - Created a more detailed chronological recap of the adventure journey
     - Preserved chapter context by showing chapter numbers and types
     - Maintained the same learning report format for educational value
     - Improved reliability through
