# Active Context

## Current Focus: Advancing Core Functionality & User Experience (As of 2025-05-21)

Following the successful completion and validation of Supabase Phase 2 (Persistent Adventure State) and Phase 3 (Telemetry, including Analytics), and the core implementation of the Visual Consistency Epic (improving protagonist and NPC visual tracking and image generation), the project is now focused on several key areas to further enhance functionality, robustness, and user experience.

### Recently Completed Milestones
*   **Supabase Integration:**
    *   Phase 2 (Persistent Adventure State): Successfully implemented and tested, enabling adventure persistence and resumption. All test cases passed (as of 2025-05-20).
    *   Phase 3 (Telemetry): Database schema defined, backend logging integrated, detailed telemetry columns added, and analytics capabilities established (completed 2025-05-21).
*   **Visual Consistency Epic (Core Implementation):**
    *   Implemented two-step image prompt synthesis for protagonist visual stability.
    *   Established a system for tracking and updating visual descriptions for all characters (protagonist and NPCs) across chapters (`state.character_visuals`).
    *   Fixed character visual extraction timing issues.
    *   Enhanced agency visual detail integration into prompts.
    *   Updated Chapter 1 prompt generation to include protagonist description.
    *   Added significant logging for visual tracking and image generation processes.

### Immediate Next Steps & Priorities

1.  **Evaluate Phase 4: User Authentication (Supabase Auth)**
    *   **Goal:** Determine feasibility and plan for implementing optional user authentication (Google/Anonymous) using Supabase.
    *   **Considerations:** Frontend/backend logic, database schema changes (linking `user_id` in `adventures` and `telemetry_events` tables), RLS policies.

2.  **Implement Resuming Chapter Image Display (Chapters 1-9)**
    *   **Goal:** Address the known issue where the original image for chapters 1-9 is not re-displayed when an adventure is resumed.
    *   **Context:** This is a follow-up enhancement to the Supabase Phase 2 (Resumption) work. Potential solutions are outlined in `wip/supabase_integration.md`.

3.  **WebSocket Disconnection Fix**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve WebSocket `ConnectionClosedOK` errors and `RuntimeError` that occur when clients navigate away (e.g., to the summary page) by improving connection lifecycle management.
    *   **Context:** Noted as a known issue in `wip/implemented/summary_chapter_race_condition.md`.

4.  **Finalize "Visual Consistency Epic"**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure full completion of the visual consistency improvements.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Add comprehensive tests specifically for the new visual consistency features.
        *   Implement explicit protagonist gender consistency checks, if deemed necessary.
        *   Update core Memory Bank documentation (`projectbrief.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`, `llmBestPractices.md`, `implementationPlans.md`) to reflect all recent visual consistency implementations.

5.  **Ongoing Supabase Considerations & Enhancements**
    *   **Goal:** Continuously improve the Supabase integration.
    *   **Tasks:** Refine user identification for resumption, enhance error handling for Supabase interactions, add specific tests for Supabase features (especially if Auth is added), implement/verify RLS policies, and monitor scalability.

6.  **General Testing Enhancements & LLM Prompt Optimization**
    *   **Goal:** Broader, ongoing improvements to overall test coverage and LLM prompt efficiency.

## Previous Focus: Testing Supabase Persistence & Resume (2025-04-27)
*(This phase is now complete and validated as of 2025-05-20. See "Recently Completed Milestones" above.)*

## Previous Focus: Logging Configuration Fix (2025-04-07)
*(Details of this completed task are preserved below for historical context but are no longer the active focus.)*

We fixed a logging configuration issue in `app/utils/logging_config.py` that caused both a `TypeError` on startup and potential `UnicodeEncodeError` during runtime on Windows.

### Problem Addressed
1.  **`TypeError` on Startup:** The `logging.StreamHandler` was incorrectly initialized with an `encoding="utf-8"` argument, which it does not accept.
2.  **`UnicodeEncodeError` during Runtime:** The default Windows console encoding (`cp1252`) could not handle certain Unicode characters, causing errors when logging messages containing them.

### Implemented Solution
1.  **Removed Invalid Argument:** Removed the `encoding="utf-8"` argument from the `logging.StreamHandler` initialization.
2.  **Wrapped `sys.stdout`:** Wrapped the standard output stream (`sys.stdout.buffer`) using `io.TextIOWrapper` configured with `encoding='utf-8'` and `errors='replace'`.
3.  **Added Basic Console Formatter:** Added a simple `logging.Formatter('%(message)s')` to the console handler.
4.  **Ensured File Handler Encoding:** Explicitly set `encoding='utf-8'` for the `logging.FileHandler`.
5.  **Added JSON File Formatter:** Added a basic JSON formatter to the file handler.

### Result
The application now starts without the `TypeError`, and console logging correctly handles Unicode characters.

### Affected Files
1.  `app/utils/logging_config.py`: Updated `setup_logging` function.
