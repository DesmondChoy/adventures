       def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
           # Initialize with default values
           if "simulation_metadata" not in kwargs:
               kwargs["simulation_metadata"] = {
                   "run_id": run_id,
                   "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
                   "random_choices": [],
               }

     - Provides better type hints for IDE support

2. **Fixed WebSocketClientProtocol Deprecation Warnings:**
   * Problem: The script was generating deprecation warnings for WebSocketClientProtocol
   * Solution:
     - Updated imports to use websockets.client
     - Updated type hints to use websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol
   * Implementation Details:
     - Changed import from `import websockets` to `import websockets.client`
     - Updated all function signatures to use the new type:
       ```python
       async def establish_websocket_connection(
           uri: str, retry_count: int = 0
       ) -> Optional[websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol]:
       ```
       ```python
       async def send_message(
           ws: websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol, message: Dict[str, Any]
       ) -> None:
       ```
       ```python
       async def process_chapter(
           websocket: websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol,
           chapter_number: int,
           is_conclusion: bool = False,
       ) -> Tuple[str, List[Dict[str, Any]]]:
       ```
       ```python
       async def process_summary(websocket: websockets.client.WebSocketClientProtocol) -> str:
       ```
   * Benefits:
     - Eliminates deprecation warnings
     - Future-proofs the code against API changes
     - Follows best practices for the websockets library

## New Chapter Summary Generator Script (2025-03-17)

1. **Created Standalone Chapter Summary Generator Script:**
   * Problem: Needed a way to generate consistent chapter summaries for all chapters, including Chapter 10 (CONCLUSION)
   * Solution:
     - Created `tests/simulations/generate_chapter_summaries.py` script that:
       * Extracts chapter content from simulation log files
       * Generates summaries using the same prompt template for all chapters
       * Uses the same function to generate summaries for all chapters (no special cases)
       * Handles missing chapters gracefully by continuing to process available chapters
   * Implementation Details:
     - Uses direct API call to Gemini with fallback to streaming approach
     - Implements retry logic with exponential backoff for reliability
     - Provides both standard and compact output formats
     - Supports skipping JSON file creation with `--no-json` flag
     - Includes detailed error handling and logging
   * Benefits:
     - Consistent summary generation for all chapters, including CONCLUSION
     - Robust error handling that continues processing even if some chapters are missing
     - Flexible output options for different use cases
     - Reliable summary generation with retry logic

## Ongoing Issue: Chapter 10 Content Not Being Captured in Simulation Log (2025-03-18)

1. **Issue with Chapter 10 Content in generate_all_chapters.py:**
   * Problem: Chapter 10 content is visible in the terminal but not being captured in the simulation log file.
   * Current Status:
     - Created `generate_all_chapters.py` script to focus solely on generating all 10 chapters
     - Modified the script to continue processing WebSocket messages after receiving the "story_complete" event
     - Added special handling for timeouts and connection closed events when processing the conclusion chapter
     - Added a new event type `EVENT:CONCLUSION_CHAPTER` to log the conclusion chapter content
   * Observed Behavior:
     - The script successfully processes chapters 1-9
     - It logs "Chapter 10 content complete (3006 chars)" in the terminal
     - It logs "EVENT:STORY_COMPLETE" in the log file
     - It logs "Waiting for conclusion chapter content..." in the log file
     - But then it times out waiting for a response: "Timeout waiting for response in chapter 10"
   * Next Steps:
     - Investigate why the WebSocket connection is being closed or timing out before Chapter 10 content can be fully processed
     - Consider increasing the timeout value for the conclusion chapter
     - Add more detailed logging to track the WebSocket connection state
     - Explore alternative approaches to capture the conclusion chapter content

## Ongoing Issue: Chapter 10 Summary Not Showing in Adventure Summary (2025-03-17)

1. **Partial Fix for WebSocket Connection Closure Issue:**
   * Problem: Chapter 10's summary is still not showing up properly in the adventure summary. The connection now stays open, but we're still seeing a placeholder summary instead of the actual content.
   * Current Status:
     - Modified `websocket_router.py` to keep the connection open after the CONCLUSION chapter
     - Changed the `break` statement to `continue` in the `is_story_complete` condition
     - Added enhanced logging in WebSocket service
     - Increased timeout for summary processing
   * Remaining Issue:
     - Despite these changes, we're still seeing a generic placeholder for Chapter 10:
     ```
     ### Chapter 10 (Conclusion)
     In the conclusion chapter, the adventure reached its resolution. The protagonist faced the final challenge and completed their journey, bringing closure to the story and reflecting on the lessons learned along the way.
     ```
     - This is the default placeholder text, not an actual summary generated from the chapter content
   * Next Steps:
     - Further investigate why the Chapter 10 summary isn't being properly generated or captured
     - Check if the summary generation is happening but not being stored correctly
     - Verify if the CONCLUSION chapter summary is being generated with the correct parameters
     - Ensure the summary is being properly included in the final state

2. **Enhanced Logging in WebSocket Service:**
   * Implementation Details:
     - Added logs for current state: `logger.info(f"Current state has {len(state.chapters)} chapters")`
     - Added logs for chapter summaries: `logger.info(f"Current chapter summaries: {len(state.chapter_summaries)}")`
     - Added logs for CONCLUSION chapter: `logger.info(f"Found CONCLUSION chapter: {conclusion_chapter.chapter_number}")`
     - Added logs for summary generation: `logger.info(f"Generated CONCLUSION chapter summary: {chapter_summary[:100]}...")`
   * Benefits:
     - Better visibility into the summary generation process
     - Easier debugging of issues with chapter summaries
     - More detailed error information when problems occur

3. **Increased Timeout for Summary Processing:**
   * Implementation Details:
     ```python
     # Added new constant
     SUMMARY_TIMEOUT = 120  # seconds specifically for summary operations
     
     # Used longer timeout for summary response
     response_raw = await asyncio.wait_for(
         websocket.recv(), timeout=SUMMARY_TIMEOUT
     )
     ```
   * Benefits:
     - Prevents timeouts during summary generation
     - Allows for more complex summary processing
     - Improves reliability of the simulation tests

## Refactored Story Simulation for Improved Maintainability (2025-03-17)

1. **Refactored `story_simulation.py` for Better Maintainability:**
   * Problem: The story simulation code had duplicate sections, inconsistent chapter summary logging, and complex nested logic
   * Solution:
     - Created dedicated helper functions for common operations
     - Standardized chapter summary logging with a single function
     - Consolidated verification steps for chapter summaries
     - Added specific error types for better error handling
   * Implementation Details:
     - Created `log_chapter_summary` function to standardize all chapter summary logging
     - Implemented `verify_chapter_summaries` function to check for missed summaries
     - Added `establish_websocket_connection` function with proper retry logic
     - Created `send_message` function for consistent WebSocket message sending
     - Added specific error types: `WebSocketConnectionError`, `ResponseTimeoutError`, `ResponseParsingError`
   * Benefits:
     - Improved maintainability with more modular code
     - Better debugging with source tracking for chapter summaries
     - Reduced code duplication for common operations
     - More consistent approach to chapter summary handling
     - Enhanced error handling with specific error types

## Standardized Chapter Summary Logging and Extraction (2025-03-16)

1. **Standardized Chapter Summary Logging in `story_simulation.py`:**
   * Problem: Chapter summaries were logged inconsistently, with the conclusion chapter (Chapter 10) using a different format than regular chapters
   * Solution:
     - Standardized all chapter summary logging to use the `EVENT:CHAPTER_SUMMARY` format
     - Implemented consistent debug logging with `"Chapter {chapter_number} summary: {content}"` format
     - Added verification steps to ensure all chapter summaries are properly logged
     - Added multiple fallback mechanisms to retroactively log any missed summaries
   * Implementation Details:
     - Modified the `summary_complete` handler to explicitly log all chapter summaries with `EVENT:CHAPTER_SUMMARY`
     - Added a verification step that checks for any missing chapter summaries
     - Added a final verification at the end of simulation to catch any remaining unlogged summaries
     - Standardized debug logging format for all chapters including the conclusion
   * Benefits:
     - Consistent logging format for all chapters (1-10) makes debugging easier
     - Multiple verification steps ensure no chapter summaries are missed
     - Improved reliability for testing and analysis tools that depend on log data
     - Better maintainability with standardized logging patterns

2. **Enhanced Chapter Summary Extraction in `show_summary_from_log.py`:**
   * Problem: The extraction script wasn't reliably finding Chapter 10 summaries due to inconsistent logging formats
   * Solution:
     - Prioritized `EVENT:CHAPTER_SUMMARY` as the primary standardized format
     - Implemented a fallback hierarchy with clear source tracking
     - Added support for both old and new logging formats
     - Added tracking of which chapters have been found to avoid duplicates
   * Implementation Details:
     - Added tracking of found chapters using a `found_chapters` set
     - Implemented a prioritized extraction approach:
       1. First try `EVENT:CHAPTER_SUMMARY` (primary standardized format)
       2. Then try `STORY_COMPLETE` event (fallback)
       3. Then try `FINAL_CHAPTER_SUMMARIES` event (fallback)
       4. Finally try direct content extraction (last resort fallback)
     - Added clear logging to show which source each chapter summary came from
     - Added support for both old "Final chapter content" and new "Chapter X summary" formats
   * Benefits:
     - More reliable extraction of all chapter summaries, including Chapter 10
     - Clear visibility into which source each summary came from
     - Backward compatibility with existing log files
     - Prioritization of the standardized format for better consistency

## Updated Story Simulation for Complete Chapter Summaries (2025-03-16)

1. **Enhanced Story Simulation for CONCLUSION Chapter Summary:**
   * Problem: The simulation was ending prematurely after the CONCLUSION chapter, before the CONCLUSION chapter summary could be generated
   * Solution:
     - Modified the "story_complete" handler to send a "reveal_summary" choice instead of immediately returning
     - Added handlers for "summary_start" and "summary_complete" message types
     - Enhanced logging for SUMMARY chapter content and events
     - Added "EVENT:FINAL_CHAPTER_SUMMARIES" log entry for the complete set of summaries
   * Implementation Details:
     - After receiving the "story_complete" message, the simulation now sends a "reveal_summary" choice
     - This simulates the user clicking the "Reveal Your Adventure Summary" button
     - The simulation then processes the SUMMARY chapter and captures all 10 chapter summaries
     - New log events track the summary generation process
   * Benefits:
     - All 10 chapter summaries (including CONCLUSION) are now captured in the simulation log
     - The simulation accurately reflects the complete user journey through the application
     - Provides comprehensive test data for verifying the chapter summary functionality
     - Ensures the SUMMARY chapter is properly tested in automated simulations

## Improved CONCLUSION Chapter Summary Generation (2025-03-16)

1. **Consistent Chapter Summary Generation for All Chapters:**
   * Problem: The CONCLUSION chapter didn't have a chapter summary to be used in the SUMMARY chapter
   * Solution:
     - Modified the client-side code in `index.html` to send a choice message with ID "reveal_summary" instead of a "request_summary" message
     - Enhanced `process_choice()` in `websocket_service.py` to handle this special choice ID and generate a summary for the CONCLUSION chapter
     - Removed the special handling for "request_summary" messages in `websocket_router.py`
     - Removed the `process_summary_request()` function from `websocket_service.py`
   * Implementation Details:
     - When the "Reveal Your Adventure Summary" button is clicked, it now sends a choice with ID "reveal_summary"
     - This choice is processed by `process_choice()` which generates a summary for the CONCLUSION chapter using `chapter_manager.generate_chapter_summary()`
     - The summary is stored in `state.chapter_summaries` just like all other chapter summaries
     - The SUMMARY chapter is then created and displayed with all chapter summaries, including the CONCLUSION chapter
   * Benefits:
     - Consistent chapter summary generation for all chapters, including the CONCLUSION chapter
     - Complete adventure recap in the SUMMARY chapter
     - Simplified architecture with a single code path for all chapter summaries
     - Improved maintainability with less special-case handling
