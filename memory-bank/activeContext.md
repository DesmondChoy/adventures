# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is implementing core Learning Odyssey features:

1. Adventure Flow Implementation (`app/services/chapter_manager.py`)
   - Landing page topic and length selection
   - ChapterType determination (LESSON/STORY)
   - Content source integration:
     - LESSON chapters: lessons.csv + LLM narrative wrapper
     - STORY chapters: Full LLM generation
   - Narrative continuity via prompt engineering

2. Content Management (`app/data/`)
   - lessons.csv integration for LESSON chapters
   - stories.yaml templates for STORY chapters
   - LLM response validation
   - History tracking in AdventureState

## Recent Changes (`app/services/llm/prompt_engineering.py`)
- Improved narrative continuity:
  * Made process_consequences() chapter-aware
  * Context-specific guidance:
    - LESSON Chapter 2: Full correction and learning
    - Later chapters: Growth and evolution focus
  * Updated build_user_prompt() with chapter context
  * Removed redundant acknowledgments
  * Enhanced progression logic

## Active Decisions

### Architecture
1. Content Flow (`app/services/chapter_manager.py`)
   - LESSON chapters:
     * Questions from lessons.csv
     * LLM narrative wrapper
     * Response validation
   - STORY chapters:
     * Full LLM generation
     * Three choices per chapter
   - Outcome tracking in AdventureState
   - Narrative continuity via prompts

2. Testing Strategy (`tests/simulations/`)
   - Story simulation framework
   - Response validation
   - State verification
   - Error handling coverage

### Implementation
1. User Experience (`app/routers/web.py`)
   - Topic selection interface
   - Adventure length selection
   - Real-time feedback system
   - WebSocket state updates

2. Flow Control (`app/services/chapter_manager.py`)
   - LESSON type enforcement for first/last chapters
   - MAX_LESSON_RATIO (40%) for middle chapters
   - Dynamic content sampling
   - Error recovery mechanisms

## Current Considerations

### Testing Framework (`tests/simulations/story_simulation.py`)
- Primary purpose:
  * Generate test data through random adventure progression
  * Provide comprehensive logs for test validation
  * Support testing requirements when core components change
- Current status:
  * Successfully generates required DEBUG level logs
  * Captures all state changes and responses
  * Maintains WebSocket communication
  * Implements robust error handling
  * Functions as intended for test data generation

### Technical
1. Performance
   - LLM response times
   - WebSocket latency
   - State synchronization speed
   - Error recovery time

2. Reliability
   - WebSocket connection stability
   - LLM service availability
   - State consistency
   - Error handling coverage

### Product
1. User Experience
   - Topic relevance
   - Narrative engagement
   - Learning effectiveness
   - Error feedback clarity

2. Content Quality
   - Question appropriateness
   - Narrative coherence
   - Choice meaningfulness
   - Learning progression

## Next Steps

### Immediate (`tests/simulations/`)
1. Testing Framework
   - Story simulation expansion
   - Performance benchmarking
   - Error scenario coverage
   - State transition validation

2. Implementation
   - WebSocket stability improvements
