## Current Focus: Post-Supabase Integration Enhancements (As of 2025-05-26)

âœ… **MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED:** Complete Supabase Integration is now PRODUCTION READY! All four phases (Prerequisites, Persistent State, Telemetry, and User Authentication with Bug Fixes) have been successfully implemented and thoroughly tested. The application now offers optional user accounts (Google/Guest), persistent adventure state, comprehensive telemetry, and robust adventure resumption with custom modal flows.

With Supabase integration complete, the project focus shifts to remaining enhancements and optimizations.

### Recently Completed Milestones
*   **Production OAuth Redirect Fix (2025-05-27):**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve critical "localhost refused to connect" errors preventing mobile users from accessing the carousel screen after Google authentication.
    *   **Problem:** After Google OAuth completion, users were redirected to localhost URLs instead of the production domain, causing connection failures on mobile devices and "loading user status..." issues.
    *   **Root Cause:** JavaScript authentication handlers used relative URLs (e.g., `/select`) which were interpreted as `localhost/select` instead of the production domain `https://learning-odyssey.up.railway.app/select` due to browser context issues after OAuth.
    *   **Tasks Completed:**
        *   Updated `redirectToSelectPage()` function in `app/templates/pages/login.html` to use absolute URLs with `window.location.origin`.
        *   Fixed all 4 redirect locations in `app/static/js/authManager.js` error handlers and logout function.
        *   Fixed both authentication success redirects in `app/static/landing/index.html`.
        *   Replaced all instances of `window.location.href = '/select'` with `window.location.href = window.location.origin + '/select'`.
    *   **Affected Files:**
        *   `app/templates/pages/login.html` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/authManager.js` (modified) 
        *   `app/static/landing/index.html` (modified)
    *   **Result:** Google OAuth now correctly redirects to production domain in all environments. Mobile users can successfully complete authentication and access the carousel screen without localhost connection errors.
    *   **Impact:** Critical production stability fix ensuring cross-environment compatibility for authentication flow.

*   **Carousel Functionality Fix (2025-05-26):**
    *   **Goal:** Restore carousel functionality that was broken after the JavaScript refactoring.
    *   **Problem:** The carousel screen where users select adventure and lesson topics was not working - clicking arrows did not rotate the carousel images.
    *   **Root Cause:** ES6 module refactoring broke carousel initialization due to missing imports, configuration overwrite, and incorrect module loading order.
    *   **Tasks Completed:**
        *   Fixed module loading order in `app/templates/components/scripts.html` to load `carousel-manager.js` before `main.js`.
        *   Added proper ES6 imports for `Carousel` and `setupCarouselKeyboardNavigation` in `main.js` and `uiManager.js`.
        *   Fixed configuration preservation by preventing `window.appConfig` overwrite in `main.js`.
        *   Added ES6 exports to `carousel-manager.js` while maintaining global availability for onclick handlers.
        *   Enhanced error handling and fallback initialization.
    *   **Affected Files:**
        *   `app/templates/components/scripts.html` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/main.js` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/uiManager.js` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/carousel-manager.js` (modified)
    *   **Result:** Carousel arrows now work correctly in both directions, allowing users to browse adventure categories and lesson topics.

*   **Client-Side JavaScript Refactoring (2025-05-26):**
    *   **Goal:** Improve modularity, maintainability, and testability of frontend JavaScript.
    *   **Tasks Completed:**
        *   Refactored the monolithic inline script in `app/templates/components/scripts.html` into multiple ES6 modules within `app/static/js/`.
        *   Created modular JavaScript files: `authManager.js`, `adventureStateManager.js`, `webSocketManager.js`, `stateManager.js`, `uiManager.js`, and `main.js`.
        *   Updated `app/templates/components/scripts.html` to load these modules and pass initial configuration data via `window.appConfig`.
        *   Established clear responsibilities for each module (authentication, local state management, WebSocket communication, UI updates, main application logic).
        *   Implemented ES6 module system with clean import/export dependencies.
    *   **Affected Files:**
        *   `app/templates/components/scripts.html` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/authManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/adventureStateManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/webSocketManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/stateManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/uiManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/main.js` (created)
    *   **Benefits:** Significantly improved code organization, maintainability, and testability of the frontend JavaScript. Reduced global namespace pollution and established clear module boundaries.

*   **Supabase Integration - Phase 4 (User Authentication - Google Flow):**
    *   **Backend Logic:** Implemented JWT verification in `websocket_router.py` using `PyJWT`.
    *   **User ID Propagation:** Ensured `user_id` (extracted from JWT) is correctly passed to `StateStorageService` and `TelemetryService`.
    *   **Database Interaction Fixes:**
        *   Resolved `TypeError: Object of type UUID is not JSON serializable` in `StateStorageService` by converting `user_id` to a string before database operations.
        *   Fixed `NULL` `user_id` issue in `telemetry_events` table for `choice_made` and `chapter_viewed` events by ensuring correct `user_id` passing in `choice_processor.py` and `stream_handler.py`.
    *   **Database Schema & RLS:** Added foreign key constraints for `user_id` in `adventures` and `telemetry_events` tables, and defined initial RLS policies. Migration applied successfully.
    *   **Debug Log Cleanup:** Removed temporary `print()` statements from `websocket_router.py`, converting to standard logging.
    *   **Google Login Flow Testing:** Successfully tested the Google login flow, verifying `user_id` is correctly populated in `adventures` and `telemetry_events` tables.
*   **Supabase Integration - Phase 3 (Telemetry):** Fully completed and validated (as of 2025-05-21). This includes schema definition, backend logging integration, detailed telemetry columns, and analytics capabilities.
*   **Supabase Integration - Phase 2 (Persistent Adventure State):** Fully completed and validated (as of 2025-05-20). Adventures are persistent, and resumption is functional.
*   **Visual Consistency Epic (Core Implementation):**
    *   Implemented two-step image prompt synthesis for protagonist visual stability.
    *   Established a system for tracking and updating visual descriptions for all characters (protagonist and NPCs) across chapters (`state.character_visuals`).
    *   Fixed character visual extraction timing issues.
    *   Enhanced agency visual detail integration into prompts.
    *   Updated Chapter 1 prompt generation to include protagonist description.
    *   Added significant logging for visual tracking and image generation processes.

### Immediate Next Steps & Priorities

1.  **Implement Resuming Chapter Image Display (Chapters 1-9)**
    *   **Goal:** Address the known issue where the original image for chapters 1-9 is not re-displayed when an adventure is resumed.
    *   **Context:** This is a follow-up enhancement to the Supabase Phase 2 (Resumption) work. Potential solutions are outlined in `wip/supabase_integration.md`.

3.  **WebSocket Disconnection Fix**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve WebSocket `ConnectionClosedOK` errors and `RuntimeError` that occur when clients navigate away (e.g., to the summary page) by improving connection lifecycle management.
    *   **Context:** Noted as a known issue in `wip/implemented/summary_chapter_race_condition.md`.

4.  **Finalize "Visual Consistency Epic"**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure full completion of the visual consistency improvements.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Add comprehensive tests specifically for the new visual consistency features.
        *   Implement explicit protagonist gender consistency checks, if deemed necessary.
        *   Update core Memory Bank documentation (`projectbrief.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`, `llmBestPractices.md`, `implementationPlans.md`) to reflect all recent visual consistency implementations.

5.  **Ongoing Supabase Considerations & Enhancements**
    *   **Goal:** Continuously improve the Supabase integration.
    *   **Tasks:** Refine user identification for resumption, enhance error handling for Supabase interactions, add specific tests for Supabase features (especially if Auth is added), implement/verify RLS policies, and monitor scalability.

6.  **General Testing Enhancements & LLM Prompt Optimization**
    *   **Goal:** Broader, ongoing improvements to overall test coverage and LLM prompt efficiency.

## Previous Focus: Testing Supabase Persistence & Resume (2025-04-27)
*(This phase is now complete and validated as of 2025-05-20. See "Recently Completed Milestones" above.)*

## Previous Focus: Logging Configuration Fix (2025-04-07)
*(Details of this completed task are preserved below for historical context but are no longer the active focus.)*

We fixed a logging configuration issue in `app/utils/logging_config.py` that caused both a `TypeError` on startup and potential `UnicodeEncodeError` during runtime on Windows.

### Problem Addressed
1.  **`TypeError` on Startup:** The `logging.StreamHandler` was incorrectly initialized with an `encoding="utf-8"` argument, which it does not accept.
2.  **`UnicodeEncodeError` during Runtime:** The default Windows console encoding (`cp1252`) could not handle certain Unicode characters, causing errors when logging messages containing them.

### Implemented Solution
1.  **Removed Invalid Argument:** Removed the `encoding="utf-8"` argument from the `logging.StreamHandler` initialization.
2.  **Wrapped `sys.stdout`:** Wrapped the standard output stream (`sys.stdout.buffer`) using `io.TextIOWrapper` configured with `encoding='utf-8'` and `errors='replace'`.
3.  **Added Basic Console Formatter:** Added a simple `logging.Formatter('%(message)s')` to the console handler.
4.  **Ensured File Handler Encoding:** Explicitly set `encoding='utf-8'` for the `logging.FileHandler`.
5.  **Added JSON File Formatter:** Added a basic JSON formatter to the file handler.

### Result
The application now starts without the `TypeError`, and console logging correctly handles Unicode characters.

### Affected Files
1.  `app/utils/logging_config.py`: Updated `setup_logging` function.
