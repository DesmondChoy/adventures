*   **Summary Page Button Fixes - FULLY RESOLVED (2025-07-05):**
    *   **Goal:** Fix React app summary page buttons to remove "Return Home" and make "Start New Adventure" redirect properly to carousel selection.
    *   **Root Causes Identified:**
        *   **"Return Home" button persistence:** React app patch script was using complex hiding strategies instead of simple DOM removal
        *   **Auto-adventure resumption:** localStorage `adventure_state` was persisting between sessions, causing automatic adventure restoration instead of carousel selection
        *   **Wrong redirect target:** "Start New Adventure" was redirecting to landing page (`/`) instead of carousel page (`/select`)
    *   **✅ FIXES COMPLETED:**
        *   **Simplified button removal:** Replaced complex hiding logic with simple `button.remove()` to completely delete "Return Home" button from DOM
        *   **Fixed redirect URL:** Updated "Start New Adventure" button to redirect to `/select` (carousel page) instead of root
        *   **Added localStorage clearing:** Clear `adventure_state`, `summary_state_id`, and `summary_api_url` before redirect to ensure fresh start
        *   **Continuous monitoring:** Added interval-based monitoring to remove any React-recreated "Return Home" buttons
    *   **✅ VERIFICATION:** Live tested and confirmed "Return Home" button is completely removed, "Start New Adventure" works as clickable button redirecting to carousel
    *   **Files Fixed:**
        *   `app/static/summary-chapter/react-app-patch.js` (simplified and fixed button handling logic)

*   **Chapter 11 Display Issue - FULLY RESOLVED (2025-07-05):**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve "Chapters Completed: 11" showing instead of 10 in summary screen.
    *   **Root Cause:** Inconsistent chapter counting logic across multiple backend methods - some filtered SUMMARY chapters, others didn't.
    *   **Problem Sources Identified:**
        *   `AdventureStateManager.format_adventure_summary_data()` used `len(state.chapters)` without filtering
        *   `SummaryService.format_adventure_summary_data()` fallback case used unfiltered count
        *   Multiple duplicate implementations with different filtering logic
    *   **✅ FIXES COMPLETED:**
        *   **Backend Consistency:** Added SUMMARY chapter filtering to all chapter counting logic in both `AdventureStateManager` and `SummaryService`
        *   **Error Fallback Fixed:** Updated error handling to use filtered chapter counts instead of `len(state.chapters)`
        *   **Code Deduplication:** Ensured consistent filtering approach across all implementations
    *   **✅ VERIFICATION:** Live tested and confirmed summary screen now correctly shows "Chapters Completed: 10"
    *   **Files Fixed:**
        *   `app/services/adventure_state_manager.py` (added SUMMARY filtering to format_adventure_summary_data)
        *   `app/services/summary/service.py` (fixed fallback error case)
        *   `app/services/summary/stats_processor.py` (already correctly filtered)

*   **AGENT.md Enhancement - COMPLETED (2025-07-01):**
    *   **Goal:** Integrate critical implementation rules from `.clinerules` into AGENT.md for future session consistency.
    *   **Implementation:** Added comprehensive sections covering state management, chapter requirements, agency implementation, dynamic content handling, image generation, and tool usage patterns.
    *   **Impact:** Future sessions will have immediate access to critical project patterns and avoid common pitfalls.

    *   **Goal:** Migrate from deprecated `google-generativeai` library to unified `google-genai` SDK for future compatibility.
    *   **Problem:** Google deprecated the old library in favor of the new unified SDK supporting all Google AI models.
    *   **Migration Completed:**
        *   Updated all imports from `import google.generativeai as genai` to `from google import genai`
        *   Replaced client initialization from `genai.configure()` + `genai.GenerativeModel()` to unified `genai.Client()`
        *   Updated API calls from model-based to client-based architecture (`client.models.generate_content()`)
        *   Fixed streaming with `generate_content_stream()` method
        *   Removed deprecated packages from requirements.txt
    *   **Files Modified:**
        *   `app/services/llm/providers.py` (complete LLM service migration)
        *   `app/services/llm/paragraph_formatter.py` (text formatting)
        *   `app/services/image_generation_service.py` (unified imports)
        *   `app/services/chapter_manager.py` (removed direct calls)
        *   `requirements.txt` (dependency cleanup)
    *   **Testing:** Post-migration testing confirmed complete functionality from first chapter through summary generation
    *   **Result:** Successfully migrated to future-proof unified Google AI SDK with 100% backward compatibility
    *   **Impact:** Application now uses latest Google AI SDK with access to new features and improved stability

*   **Frontend UX Accuracy Improvements - COMPLETED (2025-06-28):**
    *   **Goal:** Eliminate misleading elements in landing page that created false expectations about app functionality.
    *   **Problems Identified:**
        *   **Orphaned Landing Page File:** `app/static/landing/index.html` existed but wasn't served, contained outdated Unsplash image
        *   **Misleading Marketing Copy:** "Face puzzles and challenges" didn't accurately describe the adaptive learning approach
        *   **Fake Interactive Preview:** Mock UI showing clickable choices and complete text contradicted actual word-by-word streaming experience
    *   **Solutions Implemented:**
        *   **Removed Orphaned File:** Deleted unused `app/static/landing/index.html` that could cause confusion
        *   **Updated Marketing Copy:** Changed "Face puzzles and challenges that reinforce learning" to "Learn through choices - when you make mistakes, the story adapts to correct misunderstandings"
        *   **Removed Misleading Preview:** Completely removed the "Adventure Preview" section showing fake interactive UI and all navigation links to it
    *   **Files Modified:**
        *   Deleted `app/static/landing/index.html` (orphaned file)
        *   Modified `app/templates/pages/login.html` (marketing copy and preview section removal)
    *   **Result:** Landing page now accurately represents the streaming-based, adaptive learning experience without setting false expectations.
    *   **Impact:** Critical UX alignment ensuring users understand the actual app functionality before starting their adventure.

*   **Chapter Numbering Display Fix - FULLY RESOLVED (2025-05-28):**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve chapter numbering timing issues where chapters displayed incorrect numbers during streaming and final chapter showed wrong numbering.
    *   **Problems Identified:**
        *   **Chapter timing during streaming:** Chapter numbers updated AFTER streaming completed instead of immediately when streaming began
        *   **Final chapter special case:** Chapter 10 showed "Chapter 9 of 10" instead of "Chapter 10 of 10" due to different code path that bypassed `chapter_update` message
        *   **Regression during fix:** Initial fix caused +1 offset making Chapter 1 show as "Chapter 2 of 10"
    *   **Root Causes Discovered:**
        *   **Normal chapters (1-9):** `chapter_update` message sent AFTER text streaming instead of BEFORE
        *   **Final chapter (10):** Used `send_story_complete()` flow which never called `send_chapter_data()` to send `chapter_update` message
        *   **Calculation error:** Used `len(state.chapters) + 1` after chapter was already appended, causing off-by-one errors
    *   **Three-Part Solution Implemented:**
        *   **Fixed chapter timing** (`app/services/websocket/stream_handler.py`): Moved `send_chapter_data()` call BEFORE `stream_text_content()`
        *   **Fixed final chapter** (`app/services/websocket/core.py`): Added `chapter_update` message to `send_story_complete()` function
        *   **Fixed calculation** (`app/services/websocket/stream_handler.py`): Use explicit `state.chapters[-1].chapter_number` instead of recalculating with state length
    *   **Debugging Journey:** 6-phase investigation including Git history analysis, code path divergence hunting, and legacy code pattern discovery
    *   **Result:** All chapters now display correct numbering immediately when choices are made. Chapter 1 shows "Chapter 1 of 10", final chapter shows "Chapter 10 of 10", and image generation syncs properly with chapter numbers.
    *   **Impact:** Critical UX improvement ensuring consistent and immediate chapter numbering feedback throughout the entire adventure experience.

*   **Critical Security Audit and Vulnerability Fixes (2025-05-28):**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve critical user data mixing vulnerability where authenticated users could access other users' adventures.
    *   **Problem:** Multiple security vulnerabilities allowing cross-user data access:
        *   Primary: WebSocket router incorrectly falling back to `client_uuid` searches for authenticated users
        *   Secondary: Summary endpoints lacking user ownership validation (bypassing RLS via service key)
        *   Frontend: Chapter display bugs showing incorrect progress numbers
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:**
        *   WebSocket router fell back to `client_uuid` even when user was authenticated, allowing access to other users' adventures
        *   Summary router used `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` which bypasses RLS policies without application-level validation
        *   Frontend race conditions with corrupted localStorage data overriding correct server data
    *   **Security Fixes Implemented:**
        *   **WebSocket Router (`app/routers/websocket_router.py`):**
            *   Added condition to only fall back to `client_uuid` for guest users (`not connection_data.get("user_id")`)
            *   Authenticated users now only access their own adventures via `user_id`
            *   Added security logging for blocked unauthorized access attempts
        *   **Summary Router (`app/routers/summary_router.py`):**
            *   Added `validate_user_adventure_access()` function for comprehensive user ownership validation
            *   Added `user_id` dependency injection to `/api/adventure-summary` and `/api/get-adventure-state/{state_id}` endpoints
            *   Implemented proper HTTP 403/404 error responses for unauthorized access
            *   Guest adventures remain accessible (`user_id IS NULL`) while user adventures require authentication
        *   **Frontend Display Fixes (`app/static/js/`):**
            *   Removed premature `updateProgress()` calls using corrupted localStorage data
            *   Added `chapter_update` message handler for new chapter progression
            *   Fixed race conditions between localStorage and server-provided data
    *   **Affected Files:**
        *   `app/routers/websocket_router.py` (modified - security fix)
        *   `app/routers/summary_router.py` (modified - security validation added)
        *   `app/static/js/webSocketManager.js` (modified - frontend fixes)
        *   `app/static/js/main.js` (modified - frontend fixes)
        *   `app/static/js/uiManager.js` (modified - frontend fixes)
    *   **Security Architecture Achieved:**
        *   **Application Layer:** User validation in all endpoints (WebSocket + REST)
        *   **Database Layer:** RLS policies prevent unauthorized database queries
        *   **Service Layer:** Comprehensive ownership validation despite service key usage
    *   **Result:** Complete user data isolation - authenticated users can only access their own adventures, guest functionality preserved, all cross-user access vectors eliminated.
    *   **Impact:** Critical security vulnerability eliminated, ensuring complete user privacy and data protection.

*   **Production OAuth Redirect Fix (2025-05-27):**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve critical "localhost refused to connect" errors preventing mobile users from accessing the carousel screen after Google authentication.
    *   **Problem:** After Google OAuth completion, users were redirected to localhost URLs instead of the production domain, causing connection failures on mobile devices and "loading user status..." issues.
    *   **Root Cause:** JavaScript authentication handlers used relative URLs (e.g., `/select`) which were interpreted as `localhost/select` instead of the production domain `https://learning-odyssey.up.railway.app/select` due to browser context issues after OAuth.
    *   **Tasks Completed:**
        *   Updated `redirectToSelectPage()` function in `app/templates/pages/login.html` to use absolute URLs with `window.location.origin`.
        *   Fixed all 4 redirect locations in `app/static/js/authManager.js` error handlers and logout function.
        *   Fixed both authentication success redirects in `app/static/landing/index.html`.
        *   Replaced all instances of `window.location.href = '/select'` with `window.location.href = window.location.origin + '/select'`.
    *   **Affected Files:**
        *   `app/templates/pages/login.html` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/authManager.js` (modified) 
        *   `app/static/landing/index.html` (modified)
    *   **Result:** Google OAuth now correctly redirects to production domain in all environments. Mobile users can successfully complete authentication and access the carousel screen without localhost connection errors.
    *   **Impact:** Critical production stability fix ensuring cross-environment compatibility for authentication flow.

*   **Carousel Functionality Fix (2025-05-26):**
    *   **Goal:** Restore carousel functionality that was broken after the JavaScript refactoring.
    *   **Problem:** The carousel screen where users select adventure and lesson topics was not working - clicking arrows did not rotate the carousel images.
    *   **Root Cause:** ES6 module refactoring broke carousel initialization due to missing imports, configuration overwrite, and incorrect module loading order.
    *   **Tasks Completed:**
        *   Fixed module loading order in `app/templates/components/scripts.html` to load `carousel-manager.js` before `main.js`.
        *   Added proper ES6 imports for `Carousel` and `setupCarouselKeyboardNavigation` in `main.js` and `uiManager.js`.
        *   Fixed configuration preservation by preventing `window.appConfig` overwrite in `main.js`.
        *   Added ES6 exports to `carousel-manager.js` while maintaining global availability for onclick handlers.
        *   Enhanced error handling and fallback initialization.
    *   **Affected Files:**
        *   `app/templates/components/scripts.html` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/main.js` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/uiManager.js` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/carousel-manager.js` (modified)
    *   **Result:** Carousel arrows now work correctly in both directions, allowing users to browse adventure categories and lesson topics.

*   **Client-Side JavaScript Refactoring (2025-05-26):**
    *   **Goal:** Improve modularity, maintainability, and testability of frontend JavaScript.
    *   **Tasks Completed:**
        *   Refactored the monolithic inline script in `app/templates/components/scripts.html` into multiple ES6 modules within `app/static/js/`.
        *   Created modular JavaScript files: `authManager.js`, `adventureStateManager.js`, `webSocketManager.js`, `stateManager.js`, `uiManager.js`, and `main.js`.
        *   Updated `app/templates/components/scripts.html` to load these modules and pass initial configuration data via `window.appConfig`.
        *   Established clear responsibilities for each module (authentication, local state management, WebSocket communication, UI updates, main application logic).
        *   Implemented ES6 module system with clean import/export dependencies.
    *   **Affected Files:**
        *   `app/templates/components/scripts.html` (modified)
        *   `app/static/js/authManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/adventureStateManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/webSocketManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/stateManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/uiManager.js` (created)
        *   `app/static/js/main.js` (created)
    *   **Benefits:** Significantly improved code organization, maintainability, and testability of the frontend JavaScript. Reduced global namespace pollution and established clear module boundaries.

### 🔴 CRITICAL DEBUGGING IN PROGRESS (2025-06-30)

**Summary Screen Data Integrity Investigation - MAJOR PROGRESS:**

#### **Original Problem (CONFIRMED):**
- **Symptom 1**: Summary screen displays "9 Chapters Completed" instead of correct 10
- **Symptom 2**: Shows generic placeholder questions ("What did you learn from this adventure?") instead of actual LESSON chapter questions
- **Impact**: Users see incomplete/incorrect adventure summary, undermining experience

#### **Root Cause Analysis COMPLETED (2025-06-30):**

**🎯 EXACT SEQUENCE DISCOVERED:**
1. ✅ **Adventure Completes Successfully**: All 10 chapters (STORY/LESSON/REFLECT/CONCLUSION) generated and saved correctly
2. ✅ **"Take a Trip Down Memory Lane" Clicked**: WebSocket `reveal_summary` flow executes properly  
3. ✅ **Summary Generation Works**: CONCLUSION summary generated, 11-chapter state (including SUMMARY chapter) saved successfully
4. 🚨 **State Corruption Occurs**: AFTER summary page loads, corrupted 9-chapter state overwrites good state
5. ❌ **Summary Display Shows Bad Data**: Loads corrupted state with wrong chapter count and missing questions

**🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: `process_stored_chapter_summaries` function (added March 23, 2025) was causing state corruption during summary display by:
- Detecting "missing summaries" in reconstructed state (due to reconstruction corruption)
- Generating new summaries for corrupted 9-chapter state
- **SAVING corrupted state back to database, overwriting good 11-chapter state**

#### **FIXES IMPLEMENTED (2025-06-30):**

**Phase 1: Removed Problematic Functions**
- ❌ **REMOVED**: `process_stored_chapter_summaries()` function from `app/services/summary/chapter_processor.py` 
- ❌ **REMOVED**: `process_stored_chapter_summaries()` call from `app/services/summary/service.py:201`
- ❌ **REMOVED**: `process_stored_lesson_questions()` call during storage operations
- ✅ **JUSTIFICATION**: These were March 2025 "bandaid fixes" causing more problems than solving

**Phase 2: Made State Reconstruction Read-Only**
- ❌ **DISABLED**: Summary generation during `reconstruct_state_from_storage()` in `app/services/adventure_state_manager.py`
- ❌ **DISABLED**: Lesson question extraction during state reconstruction  
- ✅ **PRINCIPLE**: State reconstruction should be purely read-only, never modify stored data

**Phase 3: Enhanced Logging**
- ✅ **ADDED**: Comprehensive logging throughout adventure flow (`[ADVENTURE FLOW]`, `[CHAPTER CREATION]`, `[STATE STORAGE]`, `[REVEAL SUMMARY]`)
- ✅ **PURPOSE**: Track exact sequence of state creation, modification, and corruption

#### **CURRENT STATUS (2025-06-30):**

**🎉 SUMMARY CORRUPTION LARGELY RESOLVED!** Major progress achieved through systematic debugging.

**✅ CRITICAL FIXES SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED:**

1. **localStorage Corruption Source Fixed** - Removed hardcoded `chapter_type: 'story'` from `main.js:82`
2. **WebSocket Timeout Logic Fixed** - Eliminated problematic fallback that overwrote good database state  
3. **Type Comparison Bug Fixed** - Fixed enum vs string comparison in `adventure_state_manager.py:747`
4. **Frontend Syntax Error Fixed** - Resolved carousel-manager.js export conflict preventing choices
5. **Chapter Creation Corruption Fixed** - Implemented corruption detection and repair system

**📊 CURRENT TEST RESULTS:**
```
✅ Knowledge questions now extracted correctly from lesson chapters
✅ No more localStorage corruption overwriting good database state
✅ WebSocket timeout only fires on genuine failures (not after success)
✅ Summary generation works via proper WebSocket flow
✅ Choice functionality restored
⚠️ Minor cosmetic issue: Chapter 11 (SUMMARY) showing in summary display
⚠️ Separate issue: WebSocket connectivity timeouts during long chapter generation
```

#### **REMAINING MINOR ISSUES:**

**Issue 1: Chapter 11 Summary Display (Low Priority)**
- **Problem**: Summary page shows 11 chapters including internal SUMMARY chapter
- **Expected**: Should only display adventure chapters 1-10 for user
- **Impact**: Cosmetic issue, doesn't affect core functionality

**Issue 2: WebSocket Connectivity Timeouts (Separate Infrastructure Issue)**
- **Problem**: WebSocket keepalive timeout during long chapter generation (Chapter 7+)
- **Symptoms**: Connection drops, adventure skips chapters, requires refresh to resume
- **Impact**: User experience interruption, but adventure state preserved and resumes correctly

#### **ARCHITECTURAL LESSONS LEARNED:**

1. **"Bandaid" functions are dangerous**: `process_stored_chapter_summaries` was added to fix missing summaries but created worse corruption
2. **Read operations must be truly read-only**: Summary display should never modify or save state  
3. **State reconstruction corruption**: Aggressive "defensive programming" can corrupt valid data during reconstruction
4. **Dual-path complexity**: WebSocket + REST fallback creates race conditions and corruption opportunities
5. **Comprehensive logging essential**: Without detailed logging, this bug would have been impossible to trace

### Immediate Next Steps & Priorities

1.  **Summary Chapter 11 Display Fix (Low Priority - 2025-06-30)**
    *   **Goal:** Hide internal SUMMARY chapter (Chapter 11) from user-facing summary display
    *   **Problem:** Summary page currently shows 11 chapters including the internally-generated SUMMARY chapter
    *   **Expected:** Summary should only display the 10 adventure chapters (STORY/LESSON/REFLECT/CONCLUSION)
    *   **Impact:** Cosmetic issue that doesn't affect functionality but may confuse users
    *   **Location:** Likely in summary display logic in React frontend or summary data processing

2.  **WebSocket Connectivity Stability (Infrastructure Enhancement - 2025-06-30)**
    *   **Goal:** Improve WebSocket connection stability during long chapter generation
    *   **Problem:** WebSocket keepalive timeouts during Chapter 7+ generation causing connection drops
    *   **Symptoms:** Adventure skips chapters, requires page refresh to resume
    *   **Investigation Areas:** WebSocket timeout configuration, keepalive settings, chunked content delivery
    *   **Impact:** User experience interruption, though adventure state is preserved

3.  **Conflict Modal Intermittent Issue (Resolved but Monitoring - 2025-05-28)**
    *   **Goal:** Monitor intermittent conflict modal display issues for Google authenticated users.
    *   **Problem:** Google authenticated users occasionally didn't see the conflict modal when attempting to start a new adventure while having an incomplete adventure.
    *   **Resolution Status:** 
        *   Issue resolved spontaneously without explicit code changes - suggests timing/state-related root cause
        *   Added comprehensive diagnostic logging to `app/static/js/uiManager.js` conflict detection logic (retained for future monitoring)
        *   Logging covers: authManager state, API endpoint determination, JWT token details, fetch responses, conflict detection logic
        *   **Diagnostic code retained** - provides valuable troubleshooting data if issue resurfaces
    *   **Likely Root Causes:** Browser/session state inconsistencies, race conditions, caching issues, or authentication token lifecycle timing
    *   **Monitoring Plan:** Continue observing for intermittent behavior; diagnostic logging will help identify patterns if issue reoccurs

2.  **Implement Resuming Chapter Image Display (Chapters 1-9)**
    *   **Goal:** Address the known issue where the original image for chapters 1-9 is not re-displayed when an adventure is resumed.
    *   **Context:** This is a follow-up enhancement to the Supabase Phase 2 (Resumption) work. Potential solutions are outlined in `wip/supabase_integration.md`.

3.  **WebSocket Disconnection Fix**
    *   **Goal:** Resolve WebSocket `ConnectionClosedOK` errors and `RuntimeError` that occur when clients navigate away (e.g., to the summary page) by improving connection lifecycle management.
    *   **Context:** Noted as a known issue in `wip/implemented/summary_chapter_race_condition.md`.

3.  **Finalize "Visual Consistency Epic"**
    *   **Goal:** Ensure full completion of the visual consistency improvements.
    *   **Tasks:**
        *   Add comprehensive tests specifically for the new visual consistency features.
        *   Implement explicit protagonist gender consistency checks, if deemed necessary.
        *   Update core Memory Bank documentation (`projectbrief.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`, `llmBestPractices.md`, `implementationPlans.md`) to reflect all recent visual consistency implementations.

4.  **General Testing Enhancements & LLM Prompt Optimization**
    *   **Goal:** Broader, ongoing improvements to overall test coverage and LLM prompt efficiency.

## Previous Focus: Logging Configuration Fix (2025-04-07)
*(Details of this completed task are preserved below for historical context but are no longer the active focus.)*

We fixed a logging configuration issue in `app/utils/logging_config.py` that caused both a `TypeError` on startup and potential `UnicodeEncodeError` during runtime on Windows.

### Problem Addressed
1.  **`TypeError` on Startup:** The `logging.StreamHandler` was incorrectly initialized with an `encoding="utf-8"` argument, which it does not accept.
2.  **`UnicodeEncodeError` during Runtime:** The default Windows console encoding (`cp1252`) could not handle certain Unicode characters, causing errors when logging messages containing them.

### Implemented Solution
1.  **Removed Invalid Argument:** Removed the `encoding="utf-8"` argument from the `logging.StreamHandler` initialization.
2.  **Wrapped `sys.stdout`:** Wrapped the standard output stream (`sys.stdout.buffer`) using `io.TextIOWrapper` configured with `encoding='utf-8'` and `errors='replace'`.
3.  **Added Basic Console Formatter:** Added a simple `logging.Formatter('%(message)s')` to the console handler.
4.  **Ensured File Handler Encoding:** Explicitly set `encoding='utf-8'` for the `logging.FileHandler`.
5.  **Added JSON File Formatter:** Added a basic JSON formatter to the file handler.

### Result
The application now starts without the `TypeError`, and console logging correctly handles Unicode characters.

### Affected Files
1.  `app/utils/logging_config.py`: Updated `setup_logging` function.
