# Architectural Decisions

## Technical Constraints

### Sequential Generation Requirements

Learning Odyssey requires sequential chapter generation due to:

1. **Sequential Dependency**
   * Each chapter requires prior chapters to be complete
   * Narrative builds upon previous events and choices
   * Adventure must be generated in real-time
   * Pre-caching future content not possible

2. **Exponential Path Growth**
   * Each choice point multiplies possible paths
   * Theoretically possible to pre-generate all branches
   * Quickly becomes impractical as adventure length increases
   * 3 choices per STORY chapter Ã— binary LESSON outcomes = exponential growth

3. **State Dependencies**
   * `AdventureState` tracks complete history
   * User choices affect narrative direction
   * Educational progress influences content
   * Agency evolution requires continuous tracking

## Implementation Solutions

1. **State Persistence**
   * Complete chapter history in localStorage
   * User choices preserved across sessions
   * Learning progress tracked
   * Agency evolution history maintained

2. **Connection Management**
   * Exponential backoff (1s to 30s)
   * Maximum 5 reconnection attempts
   * Automatic state restoration
   * Silent recovery attempts

3. **Error Recovery**
   * Progress preservation during errors
   * Automatic recovery attempts
   * Clear user feedback
   * Graceful degradation
   * Image generation fallbacks

## Technical Impact

### Client-Side Requirements
- Complete state history in localStorage
- Robust connection management
- Reconnection with exponential backoff
- Progressive enhancement for images

### Server-Side Requirements
- Efficient state restoration
- Validated state handling
- Consistent chapter sequencing
- Proper error boundaries
