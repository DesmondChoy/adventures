## 2025-02-25: Final Chapter Sequence Testing Implementation

### Problem
The Final Chapter Sequence (from `app/services/chapter_manager.py`) was not being captured in the logs when running simulation tests, making it difficult to validate that the actual chapter types matched the planned sequence.

### Solution
1. Modified `get_chapter_sequence` function in `log_utils.py` to first check if a Final Chapter Sequence exists in the log file using the `get_final_chapter_sequence` function, and if it does, use that sequence instead of trying to extract it from other log entries.

2. Created a new test file `test_chapter_type_assignment.py` with three comprehensive tests:
   - `test_chapter_type_assignment_consistency`: Verifies that the planned chapter types match the actual chapter types used in the simulation
   - `test_chapter_type_assignment_rules`: Validates that the chapter type assignment follows all the required rules (first two chapters are STORY, last is CONCLUSION, etc.)
   - `test_extract_chapter_manager_logic`: Directly extracts and validates the chapter sequence from the log file

### Results
All tests are now passing, confirming that:
1. The Final Chapter Sequence is properly captured in the logs
2. The actual chapter types match the planned sequence
3. The chapter type assignment follows all the required rules

This implementation allows for reliable comparison of the Final Chapter Sequence against the actual ChapterType assignments in tests.
