# Progress Log

## Recently Completed (Last 14 Days)

### 2025-05-26: Carousel Functionality Fix
- **Goal:** Restore carousel functionality that was broken after the JavaScript refactoring.
- **Problem:** The carousel screen where users select adventure and lesson topics was not working - clicking arrows did not rotate the carousel images.
- **Root Cause:** ES6 module refactoring broke carousel initialization due to missing imports, configuration overwrite, and incorrect module loading order.
- **Tasks Completed:**
    - Fixed module loading order in `app/templates/components/scripts.html` to load `carousel-manager.js` before `main.js`.
    - Added proper ES6 imports for `Carousel` and `setupCarouselKeyboardNavigation` in `main.js` and `uiManager.js`.
    - Fixed configuration preservation by preventing `window.appConfig` overwrite in `main.js`.
    - Added ES6 exports to `carousel-manager.js` while maintaining global availability for onclick handlers.
    - Enhanced error handling and fallback initialization.
- **Affected Files:**
    - `app/templates/components/scripts.html` (modified)
    - `app/static/js/main.js` (modified)
    - `app/static/js/uiManager.js` (modified)
    - `app/static/js/carousel-manager.js` (modified)
- **Result:** Carousel arrows now work correctly in both directions, allowing users to browse adventure categories and lesson topics.

### 2025-05-26: Client-Side JavaScript Refactoring for Modularity
- **Goal:** Improve modularity, maintainability, and testability of frontend JavaScript.
- **Tasks Completed:**
    - Successfully refactored the inline JavaScript in `app/templates/components/scripts.html` into a modular ES6 structure.
    - Created new modules in `app/static/js/`: `authManager.js`, `adventureStateManager.js`, `webSocketManager.js`, `stateManager.js`, `uiManager.js`, and `main.js`.
    - Each module now handles a specific concern (authentication, local state, WebSocket communication, UI updates, application entry point).
    - `scripts.html` has been updated to load these modules and provide initial configuration via `window.appConfig`.
    - Implemented ES6 module system with clean import/export dependencies.
    - Established clear responsibilities for each module with proper separation of concerns.
- **Benefits:** This change significantly improves code organization, maintainability, and testability of the frontend JavaScript. Reduced global namespace pollution and established clear module boundaries.

### 2025-05-24: Supabase Integration - Phase 4 (User Authentication) - Key Fixes & Google Flow Verification
- **Backend Logic & JWT Handling:**
    - Implemented JWT verification in `app/routers/websocket_router.py` using `PyJWT` for secure token processing.
    - Ensured `user_id` (extracted from JWT `sub` claim) is correctly converted to a UUID object and stored in `connection_data`.
    - Removed temporary debug `print()` statements from `websocket_router.py`, transitioning to standard logging.
- **Database Interaction Fixes:**
    - Resolved `TypeError: Object of type UUID is not JSON serializable` in `app/services/state_storage_service.py` by ensuring `user_id` is converted to a string before database insertion/update in the `store_state` method.
    - Corrected `NULL` `user_id` issue in the `telemetry_events` table for `choice_made` and `chapter_viewed` events. This involved updating `app/services/websocket/choice_processor.py` and `app/services/websocket/stream_handler.py` to correctly pass the `user_id` from `connection_data` to the `TelemetryService`.
- **Google Login Flow Testing:**
    - Successfully tested the Google Login flow.
    - Verified that `user_id` is correctly populated as a string in both the `adventures` table (via `StateStorageService`) and the `telemetry_events` table (for `adventure_started`, `chapter_viewed`, and `choice_made` events).
- **Documentation:** Updated `wip/supabase_integration.md` to reflect these fixes and the successful test of the Google Login flow.

### 2025-05-21: Supabase Integration - Phase 3 (Telemetry) Fully Completed
- **Telemetry Schema & Logging:** Defined `telemetry_events` table, integrated backend logging for key events (`adventure_started`, `chapter_viewed`, `choice_made`, `summary_viewed`) using `TelemetryService`. (as per `wip/supabase_integration.md`)
- **Detailed Telemetry Columns:** Enhanced `telemetry_events` with `chapter_type`, `chapter_number`, `event_duration_seconds`, and `environment` columns. Updated backend code to populate these. (as per `wip/supabase_integration.md`)
- **Telemetry Analytics:** Established analytics capabilities for telemetry data. (User confirmed 2025-05-21)
- Resolved various bugs related to telemetry implementation (module imports, schema cache, await expressions, attribute errors).

### 2025-05-21: Visual Consistency Epic (Core Implementation Completed)
- **Protagonist Visual Stability:** Implemented two-step image prompt synthesis (`synthesize_image_prompt`) using Gemini Flash to logically combine base protagonist look, agency details, and scene descriptions, significantly improving protagonist visual consistency. (as per `wip/implemented/protagonist_inconsistencies.md`)
- **NPC & Character Evolution Tracking:** Established a system to track and update visual descriptions for all characters (protagonist and NPCs) across chapters using `CHARACTER_VISUAL_UPDATE_PROMPT` and storing them in `state.character_visuals`. (as per `wip/implemented/characters_evolution_visual_inconsistencies.md`)
- **Chapter 1 Prompt Update:** Updated `FIRST_CHAPTER_PROMPT` and `build_first_chapter_prompt` to incorporate the protagonist's description from the start. (as per `wip/implemented/protagonist_inconsistencies.md`)
- **Agency Visual Enhancement:** Improved storage and use of agency visual details in image prompts. (as per `wip/implemented/agency_visual_details_enhancement.md`)
- **Visual Extraction Fixes:** Resolved timing issues in character visual extraction by using non-streaming API calls and synchronous processing for this step. (as per `wip/implemented/character_visual_extraction_timing_fix.md`)
- **Image for CONCLUSION Chapter:** Ensured consistent image generation for the CONCLUSION chapter. (as per `wip/implemented/improve_image_consistency.md`)
- **Logging:** Added significant logging for visual tracking, prompt synthesis, and image generation processes.

- Standardized `STORY_COMPLETE` event logic (`wip/implemented/story_complete_event.md`).

### Known Issues
- **WebSocket Disconnection Error:** Navigating from adventure to summary page can cause `ConnectionClosedOK` errors in logs as the server attempts to send to a closed WebSocket. (Noted in `wip/implemented/summary_chapter_race_condition.md`)
- **Resuming Chapter Image Display (Chapters 1-9):** Original images for resumed chapters (1-9) are not currently re-displayed. (Noted in `wip/supabase_integration.md`)

## Next Steps

1.  **Evaluate Phase 4: User Authentication (Supabase Auth)**
    *   Determine feasibility and plan for implementing optional user authentication (Google/Anonymous) using Supabase.
    *   Considerations: Frontend/backend logic, database schema changes, RLS policies.

2.  **Implement Resuming Chapter Image Display (Chapters 1-9)**
    *   Address the known issue where the original image for chapters 1-9 is not re-displayed when an adventure is resumed.
    *   Refer to potential solutions in `wip/supabase_integration.md`.

3.  **WebSocket Disconnection Fix**
    *   Resolve WebSocket `ConnectionClosedOK` errors by improving connection lifecycle management.

4.  **Finalize "Visual Consistency Epic"**
    *   **Comprehensive Testing:** Add specific tests for the new visual consistency features.
    *   **Protagonist Gender Consistency:** Implement explicit checks if still required.
    *   **Update Core Memory Bank Documentation:** Revise `projectbrief.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`, `llmBestPractices.md`, and `implementationPlans.md` to reflect recent visual consistency implementations.

5.  **Ongoing Supabase Considerations & Enhancements**
    *   Refine user identification for resumption, enhance error handling for Supabase interactions, add specific tests for Supabase features (especially if Auth is added), implement/verify RLS policies, and monitor scalability.

6.  **General Testing Enhancements & LLM Prompt Optimization**
    *   Broader, ongoing improvements to overall test coverage and LLM prompt efficiency.
