2. Performance bottlenecks identified
3. Error scenario coverage gaps
4. Edge case handling needed

### LLM Integration (`app/services/llm/`)
2. OpenAI/Gemini cross-testing needed
3. Response format standardization pending
4. Rate limiting implementation required
5. Error recovery improvements needed

### Content Flow (`app/services/chapter_manager.py`)
1. Question sampling optimization needed
2. State persistence refinement
3. Error recovery enhancement

## Next Milestones

### Short Term
