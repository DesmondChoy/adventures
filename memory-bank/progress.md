# Progress Log

## 2025-03-11: Enhanced Summary Implementation with Progressive Chapter Summaries

### Improved SUMMARY Chapter with Progressive Chapter Summaries
- Problem: The original SUMMARY chapter implementation generated the entire summary at the end of the adventure, which could be slow and less detailed
- Solution:
  * Enhanced the AdventureState model to store chapter summaries throughout the adventure:
    - Added `chapter_summaries` field to the AdventureState model to store summaries as they're generated
    - Maintained compatibility with the existing SUMMARY chapter type
  * Modified the process_choice function to generate summaries progressively:
    - Added code to generate a chapter summary after each user choice
    - Used the existing `generate_chapter_summary` method from ImageGenerationService
    - Stored summaries in the AdventureState's chapter_summaries list
    - Added error handling to ensure the main flow continues even if summary generation fails
  * Rewrote the generate_summary_content function to use stored summaries:
    - Created a chronological recap using the stored chapter summaries
    - Preserved chapter context by showing chapter numbers and types
    - Maintained the same learning report format for educational value
    - Added fallback to the original LLM-based summary generation if no summaries are available
  * Leveraged existing infrastructure:
    - Reused the same summary generation logic that's already used for image prompts
    - Maintained backward compatibility with the existing summary functionality
    - Kept the same UI flow with the "Reveal Your Adventure Summary" button
- Technical Advantages:
  * Distributed processing - summaries generated throughout the adventure instead of all at once at the end
  * More resilient - if one chapter summary fails, others can still be displayed
  * Reduced wait time at the end of the adventure
  * Better captures "in-the-moment" details that might be lost in a retrospective summary
- User Experience Benefits:
  * More detailed visualization of the journey through each chapter
  * Clearer connections between specific chapters and learning moments
  * Faster summary generation at the end of the adventure
  * More journey-like experience showing how the story evolved

## 2025-03-10: Fixed Paragraph Formatter Bug

### Fixed Paragraph Formatter Using Incomplete Text
- Problem: Paragraph formatter was detecting text without proper paragraph formatting, but only reformatting the initial buffer instead of the full response
- Root Cause:
  * In both OpenAIService and GeminiService, when text needed formatting, the system was passing `collected_text` (initial buffer) to the reformatting function instead of `full_response` (complete text)
  * This resulted in properly formatted initial text but the remainder of the response still lacked paragraph breaks
  * Debug logs showed the detection was working, but the reformatted text wasn't being fully utilized
- Solution:
  * Modified all instances in both service classes to use `full_response` instead of `collected_text` when reformatting is needed:
    - Updated OpenAIService.generate_with_prompt
    - Updated OpenAIService.generate_chapter_stream
    - Updated GeminiService.generate_with_prompt
    - Updated GeminiService.generate_chapter_stream
  * Maintained the existing retry mechanism (up to 3 attempts with progressively stronger formatting instructions)
  * No changes were needed to the paragraph detection logic or the reformatting function itself
- Result:
  * Complete LLM responses now have proper paragraph formatting throughout the entire text
  * Improved readability for users, especially for longer responses
  * Maintained the streaming experience when formatting isn't needed
  * Fixed the issue where debug logs showed detection and reformatting but the output still lacked proper formatting

## 2025-03-10: Implemented Summary Page After CONCLUSION Chapter

### Added Summary Page Feature
- Problem: The adventure ended abruptly after the CONCLUSION chapter without a proper summary of the journey
- Solution:
  * Added a new SUMMARY chapter type to provide a recap of the adventure:
    - Updated `story.py` to add SUMMARY to the ChapterType enum
    - Modified ChapterData validation to accommodate SUMMARY chapters
    - Added a create_summary_chapter method to ChapterManager
  * Implemented backend services for summary generation:
    - Created `build_summary_chapter_prompt` function in `prompt_engineering.py` to generate prompts for the summary
    - Added `generate_summary_content` function in `websocket_service.py` to use the LLM to generate the summary content
    - Implemented `process_summary_request` function to handle summary requests from the client
  * Enhanced the frontend to support the summary page:
    - Added a "Reveal Your Adventure Summary" button at the end of the CONCLUSION chapter
    - Implemented handlers for summary-related WebSocket messages
    - Added smooth transitions between conclusion and summary pages
  * Followed architectural best practices:
    - Separated prompt engineering logic from service layer implementation
    - Used consistent naming conventions with other chapter-related functions
    - Maintained clear separation of concerns between components
- Result:
  * Users now have a satisfying conclusion to their adventure with a summary page
  * The summary includes a narrative recap of the journey and a learning report
  * Questions, answers, and explanations are displayed in an organized format
  * The implementation follows the existing architectural patterns
  * The feature enhances the educational value of the application

## 2025-03-10: Fixed Chapter Summary Generation for Image Prompts

### Fixed Chapter Summary Generation for Image Prompts
- Problem: Chapter summaries generated by the LLM weren't being included in image generation prompts
- Root Cause:
  * Mismatch between how the streaming response was being collected from different LLM providers
  * The Gemini API's streaming response wasn't being properly captured in the async for loop
  * The summary was being generated but then lost or misinterpreted as empty
- Solution:
  * Implemented service-specific handling for different LLM providers:
    - For Gemini: Used direct API call instead of streaming for summary generation
    - For OpenAI: Maintained the streaming approach which works correctly
  * Added comprehensive logging to track the raw response, its length, and processed summary
  * Enhanced empty check to consider very short summaries (less than 5 characters) as empty
  * Improved fallback mechanism to use the first paragraph of chapter content when needed
- Implementation Details:
  * Added detection of which LLM service is being used (Gemini or OpenAI)
  * Used a more robust approach to collecting chunks from streaming responses
  * Added explicit error handling with graceful fallbacks
  * Implemented detailed logging at each step of the process
- Key Learning:
  * Different LLM service providers require different implementation approaches for the same functionality
  * Streaming responses work differently between OpenAI and Gemini APIs
  * Direct API calls are more reliable than streaming for short, single-response use cases
  * Always implement robust fallback mechanisms for LLM-dependent features
- Result:
  * Chapter summaries are now properly included in image generation prompts
  * More relevant and contextual images for each chapter
  * Consistent inclusion of agency choice from Chapter 1 in all images
  * Improved reliability with better error handling and logging

## 2025-03-09: Implemented Paragraph Formatting for LLM Responses

### Enhanced Text Readability with Automatic Paragraph Formatting
- Problem: LLM responses occasionally lacked proper paragraph breaks, causing text to render as one continuous paragraph
- Root Cause:
  * Despite system prompt instructions to "Format responses with clear paragraph breaks", the LLM sometimes failed to include proper paragraph breaks
  * This resulted in a wall of text that was difficult to read, especially on mobile devices
  * The issue occurred randomly but frequently enough to impact user experience
- Solution:
  * Created a new `paragraph_formatter.py` module with functions to detect and fix text without proper paragraph formatting:
    - `needs_paragraphing()`: Detects text that needs formatting based on length, existing paragraph breaks, sentence count, and dialogue markers
    - `reformat_text_with_paragraphs()`: Uses the same LLM service to add proper paragraph breaks with multiple retry attempts
  * Modified both OpenAIService and GeminiService to implement a two-phase approach:
    - Phase 1: Collect initial buffer to check formatting needs
    - Phase 2: If formatting needed, collect full response and reformat; if not, stream normally
  * Implemented multiple retry attempts (up to 3) with progressively stronger formatting instructions:
    - First attempt: Basic formatting instructions
    - Second attempt: Adds emphasis on including blank lines between paragraphs
    - Third attempt: Adds very explicit instructions about using double line breaks
  * Added comprehensive logging of prompts and responses for debugging
  * Fixed a syntax error related to f-strings with backslashes by defining strings outside the f-string
- Result:
  * Ensures all LLM responses have proper paragraph formatting for better readability
  * Maintains streaming experience when formatting isn't needed
  * Provides detailed logging for monitoring and debugging
  * Gracefully handles cases where reformatting fails by returning the original text
  * Improves user experience with more readable text, especially for longer responses

## 2025-03-09: Fixed Chapter Image Display on Desktop

### Fixed Chapter Image Display Issues Across Devices
- Problem: Chapter images were being cropped on desktop but displaying correctly on mobile
- Root Cause:
  * The CSS for chapter images used `object-fit: cover` which crops images to fill the container
  * The container had a fixed max-height (300px on mobile, 450px on desktop)
  * The `overflow: hidden` property was preventing the full image from being visible
  * This caused the top and bottom of images to be cut off on desktop, particularly for taller images
- Solution:
  * Changed `object-fit` from "cover" to "contain" to preserve the image's aspect ratio
  * Kept `overflow: hidden` to prevent layout issues
  * Increased the max-height for desktop from 450px to 600px
  * Added additional margin between the image and choice buttons
  * Used media queries to apply different styles for desktop and mobile
- Result:
  * Images now display correctly on both desktop and mobile
  * Full image is visible without cropping on all devices
  * Proper spacing between image and choice buttons
  * Consistent user experience across all device sizes
  * No changes required to server-side code or image generation logic

## 2025-03-09: Improved Chapter Image Positioning

### Optimized Chapter Image Placement for Young Users
- Problem: Chapter images were displayed at the top of content, causing children to wait for images before reading text
- Root Cause:
  * Images were positioned above the story content in the UI
  * Children aged 6-12 had to wait for image generation before engaging with the text
  * This created a perceived delay and potential disengagement
  * The layout didn't follow the natural "read first, then see illustration" pattern common in children's books
- Solution:
  * Moved the `<div id="chapterImageContainer">` element in index.html to appear after the story content but before the choices container
  * Added a mb-6 margin-bottom class to ensure proper spacing between the image and the choice buttons
  * Kept all existing functionality intact, including the fade-in animation and asynchronous loading
  * No changes required to server-side code or image generation logic
- Result:
  * Immediate Engagement - Children can start reading text immediately without waiting for image generation
  * Reduced Perceived Delay - The delay in image loading becomes less noticeable when they're already engaged with the story content
  * Better Narrative Flow - The image now serves as a visual summary of what they've just read, reinforcing the content
  * Natural Reading Pattern - Follows a more natural "read first, then see illustration" pattern common in children's books
  * Smoother Transition - Creates a visual break between the story content and choice selection
  * More effective layout for children in the 6-12 age range
  * Creates a more seamless and engaging experience

## 2025-03-09: Images for Every Chapter

### Added Images to All Chapters for Enhanced Visual Storytelling
- Problem: Images were only shown for the first chapter's agency choices, missing opportunities for visual storytelling in later chapters
- Root Cause:
  * The image generation functionality was only implemented for the first chapter
  * No mechanism existed to generate images based on chapter content for subsequent chapters
  * The frontend only displayed images for agency choices in the first chapter
- Solution:
  * Modified `ImageGenerationService` to generate images for all chapters:
    - Added `generate_chapter_summary` method to create visual summaries from previous chapter content
    - Updated `enhance_prompt` to handle chapter summaries as input for image generation
    - Implemented LLM-based summarization of chapter content for image prompts
  * Updated `prompt_engineering.py` to support prompt overrides:
    - Added a context parameter to the `build_prompt` function
    - Implemented special handling for prompt_override in the context
    - Modified both LLM service providers to pass the context parameter
  * Enhanced `websocket_service.py` to generate images for all chapters:
    - Added code to generate chapter summaries from previous chapter content
    - Created image generation tasks for all chapters, not just the first one
    - Added a new message type (`chapter_image_update`) for sending chapter images
  * Updated the frontend to display chapter images at the top of each chapter:
    - Added a container for chapter images
    - Implemented handling for the new `chapter_image_update` message type
    - Added smooth fade-in animations for chapter images
- Result:
  * Every chapter now has a relevant image at the top
  * Images are generated based on the content of the current chapter (better for children aged 6-12)
  * Agency choices are consistently referenced in the images
  * Enhanced visual storytelling experience throughout the adventure
  * Improved user engagement with visual elements for every chapter

## 2025-03-09: Landing Page Integration

### Integrated Landing Page as Application Entry Point
- Problem: The application needed a dedicated landing page to introduce users to the concept before they start an adventure
- Implementation:
  * Created a responsive landing page at `app/static/landing/index.html` with:
    - Modern, visually appealing design with animations and clean layout
    - Sections for "How It Works", "Features", and "Adventure Preview"
    - Multiple "Start your adventure" buttons linking to the adventure selection page
    - Fully responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices
    - Tailwind CSS for styling with custom animations and glass effects
  * Updated web router in `app/routers/web.py` to:
    - Serve the landing page at the root URL (/)
    - Maintain the adventure selection page at /adventure
    - Ensure proper navigation between pages
  * Key features of the landing page:
    - Hero section with animated background elements and clear call-to-action
    - Step-by-step explanation of how the educational adventure works
    - Feature highlights showcasing personalized learning, immersive storytelling, etc.
    - Adventure preview section showing a sample chapter with choices
    - Consistent navigation with links to different sections
- Result:
  * The application now has a proper entry point that explains the concept to new users
  * Users can understand the educational adventure concept before starting
  * Seamless transition from landing page to adventure selection
  * Improved user experience with a professional, modern first impression
  * Fully responsive design works well on all device sizes

## 2025-03-09: Improved Topic Introduction in Lesson Chapters

### Enhanced Topic Introduction in Lesson Chapters
- Problem: LESSON_CHAPTER_PROMPT was directly referencing the specific question in the topic introduction
- Root Cause:
  * The template used `Introduce the topic of this question:"{question}"` which focused too narrowly on the specific question
  * This made the narrative flow less natural, as it jumped directly to the specific question rather than introducing the broader topic first
  * The broader topic information (like "Farm Animals" or "Singapore History") was already available in the lesson data but wasn't being utilized
- Solution:
  * Modified the LESSON_CHAPTER_PROMPT template in `prompt_templates.py` to use the broader topic:
    ```python
    # Changed from:
    2. Topic Introduction: Introduce the topic of this question:"{question}" early in the chapter, through character observations, dialogue, or events. Build a sense of curiosity or need-to-know around this topic.
    
    # To:
    2. Topic Introduction: Introduce the topic of {topic} early in the chapter, through character observations, dialogue, or events. Build a sense of curiosity or need-to-know around this topic.
    ```
  * Updated the `build_lesson_chapter_prompt` function in `prompt_engineering.py` to pass the topic parameter when formatting the template:
    ```python
    return LESSON_CHAPTER_PROMPT.format(
        # other parameters...
        question=lesson_question["question"],
        formatted_answers=formatted_answers,
        topic=lesson_question["topic"],  # Added this line
    )
    ```
- Result:
  * Lesson chapters now introduce the broader topic (like "Farm Animals" or "Singapore History") rather than directly referencing the specific question
  * Creates a more natural flow for educational content by introducing the broader topic area first before narrowing down to the specific question
  * Uses the topic value that's already available in the lesson data from CSV files
  * Improves the narrative quality by allowing for a more gradual introduction to the educational content

## 2025-03-08: Enhanced CORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES and INCORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES Templates

### Improved Learning Impact with Explanation Integration
- Problem: The CORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES and INCORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES templates weren't using the explanation column from lesson data
- Root Cause:
  * The explanation field was loaded from CSV files and stored in the question data
  * However, it wasn't being included in the templates for learning impact
  * This meant valuable educational content wasn't being shown in the story when a student answered a question
- Solution:
  * Modified the templates in `prompt_templates.py` to include the explanation:
    ```python
    CORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES = """## Learning Impact
    - Show how understanding {question} connects to their current situation
    - Build confidence from this success that carries into future challenges: "{explanation}"
    - Integrate this knowledge naturally into the character's approach"""

    INCORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES = """## Learning Impact
    - Acknowledge the misunderstanding about {question}
    - Create a valuable learning moment from this correction: "{explanation}"
    - Show how this new understanding affects their approach to challenges"""
    ```
  * Updated the `process_consequences` function in `prompt_engineering.py` to extract and pass the explanation:
    ```python
    # Get the explanation from the lesson question, or use a default if not available
    explanation = lesson_question.get("explanation", "")
    
    if is_correct:
        return CORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES.format(
            correct_answer=correct_answer,
            question=lesson_question["question"],
            explanation=explanation,
        )
    else:
        return INCORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES.format(
            chosen_answer=chosen_answer,
            correct_answer=correct_answer,
            question=lesson_question["question"],
            explanation=explanation,
        )
    ```
- Result:
  * When a student answers a question incorrectly, the prompt now includes the specific explanation from the lesson data
  * For example, if a student incorrectly answers a question about the 1964 Singapore riots, the prompt will include the detailed explanation about ethnic tensions and political conflicts
  * This provides more context for the learning moment and helps the LLM create more educational content
  * The implementation is minimal and focused, affecting only the consequences templates
  * Gracefully handles cases where explanations might be missing by using an empty string as default

## 2025-03-08: Fixed Question Difficulty Default in WebSocket Service

### Fixed Question Difficulty Default in WebSocket Service
- Problem: "Very Challenging" questions were still being selected for Chapter 2 despite the fix to default to "Reasonably Challenging" in the `sample_question()` function
- Root Cause:
  * While the `sample_question()` function in `app/init_data.py` was correctly updated to default to "Reasonably Challenging"
  * In `websocket_service.py`, the difficulty was being retrieved from state metadata with a default of `None`:
    ```python
    # Get difficulty from state metadata if available (for future difficulty toggle)
    difficulty = state.metadata.get("difficulty", None)
    ```
  * This `None` value was then passed to `sample_question()`, which overrode the default parameter value
  * Even though `sample_question()` had a default parameter of "Reasonably Challenging", it was never used because `None` was explicitly passed
- Solution:
  * Modified the code in `websocket_service.py` to use "Reasonably Challenging" as the default when retrieving from state metadata:
    ```python
    # Get difficulty from state metadata if available (for future difficulty toggle)
    difficulty = state.metadata.get("difficulty", "Reasonably Challenging")
    ```
  * This ensures that even if no difficulty is set in the state metadata, it will default to "Reasonably Challenging"
- Result:
  * Questions now consistently default to "Reasonably Challenging" when no difficulty is explicitly provided
  * Fixed the specific issue with the question "What does it mean when a farm animal exhibits repetitive behaviors?" in Chapter 2
  * Maintains flexibility for a future UI toggle to override this default
  * Ensures consistent behavior regardless of how the function is called

## 2025-03-08: Fixed Question Placeholder in REFLECT Chapters

### Fixed Missing Question Placeholder Replacement in Reflection Chapters
- Problem: The `{question}` placeholder in the exploration_goal wasn't being properly replaced in REFLECT chapters
- Root Cause:
  * In `prompt_templates.py`, the REFLECT_CONFIG dictionary contains an exploration_goal with a `{question}` placeholder:
    ```python
    "exploration_goal": "discover the correct understanding of {question} through guided reflection"
    ```
  * When this config was used in `prompt_engineering.py` to build the REFLECT chapter prompt, the `{question}` placeholder wasn't being replaced
  * The placeholder was being treated as a literal string, not as a placeholder to be replaced with the actual question
- Solution:
  * Modified `build_reflect_chapter_prompt` in `prompt_engineering.py` to format the exploration_goal with the actual question before inserting it into the prompt:
    ```python
    # Format the exploration_goal with the actual question
    formatted_exploration_goal = config["exploration_goal"].format(
        question=previous_lesson.question["question"]
    )
    ```
  * Updated the REFLECT_CHAPTER_PROMPT.format() call to use the formatted_exploration_goal instead of the raw config["exploration_goal"]
- Result:
  * REFLECT chapters now properly include the actual question in the exploration_goal
  * The LLM receives the correct guidance to help the character discover the correct understanding of the specific question
  * Fixed the issue where "the correct understanding of {question}" wasn't loading correctly in the REFLECT chapter prompt

## 2025-03-08: Utilized Explanation Column in REFLECT Chapters

### Enhanced Educational Content in Reflection Chapters
- Problem: The `explanation` column in lesson CSV files wasn't being utilized in the prompts
- Root Cause:
  * The explanation field was loaded from CSV files and stored in the question data
  * However, it wasn't being passed to the LLM in any of the prompt templates
  * This meant valuable educational content was being ignored in the story generation
- Solution:
  * Modified `REFLECT_CHAPTER_PROMPT` in `prompt_templates.py` to include a new "Educational Context" section
  * Added an `explanation_guidance` parameter to the template
  * Updated `build_reflect_chapter_prompt` in `prompt_engineering.py` to:
    - Extract the explanation from the question data
    - Create an explanation guidance string that incorporates the explanation
    - Add a fallback message for cases where no explanation is provided
    - Pass the explanation_guidance parameter to the template
- Result:
  * REFLECT chapters now include the explanation from the CSV file
  * The LLM can create more educationally sound reflection chapters
  * Students receive better explanations of concepts, regardless of whether they answered correctly or incorrectly
  * The implementation is minimal and focused, only affecting REFLECT chapters
  * Gracefully handles cases where explanations might be missing

## 2025-03-08: Fixed Question Difficulty Default

### Set Default Difficulty for Question Sampling
- Problem: "Very Challenging" questions were being selected instead of defaulting to "Reasonably Challenging" as expected
- Root Cause:
  * The `sample_question()` function in `app/init_data.py` had no default value for the `difficulty` parameter
  * Without an explicit difficulty setting, the system randomly sampled from all available questions regardless of difficulty
  * A TODO comment indicated this was meant to be controlled by a UI toggle that hasn't been implemented yet
- Solution:
  * Modified the `sample_question()` function to set the default difficulty parameter to "Reasonably Challenging"
  * Updated the docstring to reflect this default value
  * Kept the existing logic that falls back to all difficulties if fewer than 3 questions are available for the specified difficulty
- Result:
  * Questions now default to "Reasonably Challenging" when no difficulty is explicitly provided
  * Maintains flexibility for a future UI toggle to override this default
  * Ensures consistent behavior regardless of how the function is called

## 2025-03-08: Completed Lesson Data Refactoring

### Removed Legacy Lessons CSV File and Updated References
- Problem: The old `app/data/lessons.csv` file was still present and referenced in some parts of the code, despite the refactoring to use individual CSV files
- Root Cause:
  * The refactoring to use individual CSV files in the `app/data/lessons/` directory was incomplete
  * The `tests/simulations/story_simulation.py` file still directly referenced the old CSV file
  * The old CSV file was still present in the repository
- Solution:
  * Updated `tests/simulations/story_simulation.py` to use the `LessonLoader` class instead of directly loading from the old CSV file
  * Removed the old `app/data/lessons.csv` file as it's no longer needed
  * Updated documentation in memory-bank files to reflect the completed transition
- Result:
  * Completed the transition to the new data structure
  * Removed redundant code and files
  * Improved consistency across the codebase
  * Simplified the lesson loading process

## 2025-03-08: Fixed Lesson Loader CSV Format Handling

### Enhanced CSV Parsing and Topic Matching
- Problem: The `LessonLoader` class wasn't correctly parsing the new CSV format with quoted fields, causing errors when filtering by topic
- Root Cause:
  * CSV files were reformatted with proper quotes around each field
  * The custom parsing logic in `LessonLoader` wasn't handling the quoted fields correctly
  * Topic matching was case-sensitive and didn't handle whitespace variations
  * Only 1 lesson was being found for "Human Body" topic when there should be 50
- Solution:
  * Completely rewrote the `load_all_lessons` method to use pandas' built-in CSV parsing with proper quoting parameters
  * Enhanced the `get_lessons_by_topic` method to use case-insensitive matching
  * Added fallback strategies for topic matching:
    - First try exact case-insensitive matching
    - Then try with stripped whitespace
    - Finally try partial matching if needed
  * Updated `get_lessons_by_difficulty` and `get_lessons_by_topic_and_difficulty` to use the same case-insensitive approach
  * Added detailed logging to help diagnose any future issues
  * Removed the fallback to the old CSV file since it's no longer needed
- Result:
  * Successfully loads all 150 lessons from the CSV files in the `app/data/lessons/` directory
  * Correctly finds all 50 lessons for the "Human Body" topic
  * More robust topic and difficulty matching with case-insensitive comparisons
  * Better error handling and logging for easier debugging
  * Fixed the "Need at least 3 questions, but only have 1" error in adventure state initialization

## 2025-03-07: Lesson Data Refactoring

### Improved Lesson Data Management with Individual Files
- Problem: Lesson data was stored in a single CSV file (`app/data/lessons.csv`), making it difficult to maintain and update
- Root Cause:
  * All lesson data was in a single CSV file, making it hard to organize by topic
  * No support for filtering by difficulty level
  * Limited flexibility for adding new lessons or updating existing ones
  * Potential for data corruption when editing a large CSV file
- Solution:
  * Created a new `LessonLoader` class in `app/data/lesson_loader.py` that:
    - Attempts to load lessons from individual CSV files in the `app/data/lessons/` directory
    - Falls back to the old `app/data/lessons.csv` file if needed
    - Handles various file encodings and formats
    - Standardizes the difficulty levels to "Reasonably Challenging" and "Very Challenging"
    - Provides methods to filter lessons by topic and difficulty
  * Updated the `sample_question` function in `app/init_data.py` to use the new `LessonLoader` class and support filtering by difficulty
  * Updated the `init_lesson_topics` function in `app/init_data.py` to handle both old and new formats
  * Ensured backward compatibility with the existing code
- Result:
  * More maintainable lesson data structure with individual files per topic
  * Support for filtering lessons by difficulty level
  * Improved error handling and logging
  * Backward compatibility with the old CSV file
  * Smooth transition path from old to new data structure

## 2025-03-07: CSS File Consolidation

### Improved Frontend Architecture with CSS Consolidation
- Problem: Too many separate CSS files were causing maintenance challenges and potential conflicts
- Root Cause:
  * CSS files were being added for specific features without considering overall organization
  * Modern UI enhancements were in a separate file from other theme-related styles
  * Potential for style conflicts or overrides between files
  * Increased complexity for developers to understand the styling structure
- Solution:
  * Merged `modern-accents.css` into `theme.css` to consolidate theme-related styles:
    - Appended modern accent styles to the end of theme.css
    - Added clear comments to separate the original theme styles from modern accents
    - Ensured all CSS variables and selectors work harmoniously
  * Removed the reference to `modern-accents.css` from `index.html`
  * Maintained organization within the combined file:
    - Original theme styles at the top
    - Modern accent enhancements in a clearly commented section
  * Verified that all styles continue to work as expected
- Result:
  * Reduced the number of CSS files from 6 to 5
  * Improved maintainability with related styles in one file
  * Better organization of theme-related styling
  * No change in functionality or appearance for end users
  * Simplified CSS loading in the HTML file

## 2025-03-07: Modern UI Enhancements

### Enhanced Visual Design with Subtle Modern Touches
- Problem: The UI was functional but felt too minimalist and lacked visual interest, especially when scrolling through text content
- Root Cause:
  * Minimal styling focused on functionality without visual depth
  * Limited use of modern CSS features like gradients, shadows, and animations
  * Lack of visual hierarchy and interactive feedback
  * Plain white backgrounds with limited texture or depth
- Solution:
  * Implemented subtle UI enhancements with modern styling techniques:
    - Added subtle background patterns and textures using SVG backgrounds
    - Enhanced depth with layered shadows and refined borders
    - Implemented micro-interactions and hover effects for better feedback
    - Created subtle gradients for buttons and cards
    - Added shine effects and transitions for interactive elements
  * Expanded the color system in `typography.css`:
    - Added new CSS variables for backgrounds, cards, and overlays
    - Created gradient variables for consistent styling
    - Added accent color variations for visual hierarchy

## 2025-03-07: Desktop & Mobile UI Alignment

### Unified UI Experience Across All Devices
- Problem: The user interface on desktop and mobile looked inconsistent, with mobile having a more modern design
- Root Cause:
  * Mobile-specific UI enhancements were not applied to desktop view
  * CSS was organized in a way that kept desktop and mobile styles separate
  * Design elements like the indigo accented line and left border accent were only applied to mobile
- Solution:
  * Applied the mobile UI enhancements to desktop view:
    - Added the indigo accented line with curved-down edges to all screen sizes
    - Applied the left border accent to choice cards on all screen sizes
    - Made the header controls consistent across devices
    - Applied a subtle gradient background to the entire app
  * Implemented specific improvements:
    - Moved the story container styling outside the mobile media query
    - Added hover effects for desktop choice cards
    - Made the header controls border-bottom consistent across all devices
    - Used semi-transparent backgrounds with backdrop blur for a modern look
    - Ensured consistent typography and spacing across devices
  * Cleaned up duplicate styles and organized the CSS files:
    - Removed redundant styles in mobile media queries
    - Created a dedicated narrative-font class for consistent text styling
    - Improved code organization with better comments
- Result:
  * Consistent brand experience across all devices
  * More modern and cohesive visual design
  * Improved readability with consistent styling
  * Better maintainability with organized CSS
  * Enhanced visual hierarchy with consistent accent colors

## 2025-03-06: CSS Files Reorganization

### Improved Frontend Architecture with CSS Organization
- Problem: There were too many standalone CSS files, making it difficult to maintain and understand the styling structure
- Root Cause:
  * CSS files were created ad-hoc as new features were added
  * No clear organization strategy for CSS files
  * Similar styles were spread across multiple files
  * No clear separation of concerns between different types of styles
- Solution:
  * Merged multiple CSS files into a more organized structure:
    - Consolidated `header-controls.css`, `font-controls.css`, `loader.css`, and `choice-cards.css` into `components.css`
    - Renamed `carousel.css` to `carousel-component.css` to better reflect its purpose
    - Kept `layout.css`, `theme.css`, and `typography.css` as separate files for their specific purposes
  * Updated the HTML file to reference the new CSS structure:
    - Removed references to the merged files
    - Added reference to the renamed carousel component file
  * Organized CSS files by their purpose:
    - `components.css` - Reusable UI components (toast notifications, buttons, loaders, choice cards, etc.)
    - `carousel-component.css` - Specialized carousel component styles
    - `layout.css` - Structural elements, containers, and screen transitions
    - `theme.css` - Color schemes and theme variables
    - `typography.css` - Text styling and formatting
- Result:
  * More maintainable CSS structure with clear separation of concerns
  * Reduced number of CSS files from 9 to 5
  * Better organization of styles by their purpose
  * Improved developer experience with easier-to-find styles
  * No change in functionality or appearance for end users

## 2025-03-06: CSS Modularization and Transition Improvements

### Improved Frontend Architecture with CSS Organization and Transitions
- Problem: CSS was scattered throughout the HTML file with inline styles and lacked organization
- Root Cause:
  * Inline styles were used for various UI components
  * No dedicated CSS files for layout and components
  * Screen transitions lacked proper animation effects
  * Error messages used inline styling instead of a reusable component
- Solution:
  * Created two new CSS files:
    - `app/static/css/layout.css` - Contains structural elements, containers, and screen transitions
    - `app/static/css/components.css` - Contains reusable UI components like toasts, buttons, and animations
  * Removed inline styles and replaced them with proper CSS classes:
    - Moved debug info styles to the components.css file
    - Added screen transition classes to all screen containers
    - Created a toast notification component for error messages
    - Added fade-in animation classes for images
  * Enhanced screen transitions:
    - Added proper transition effects between screens
    - Improved the navigation functions to handle transitions correctly
    - Added comments to clarify the transition logic
  * Improved code maintainability:
    - Organized CSS into logical modules
    - Added descriptive comments to explain the purpose of each section
    - Used consistent naming conventions for classes
- Result:
  * More maintainable codebase with better organized CSS
  * Smoother screen transitions throughout the application
  * Improved user experience with consistent animations
  * Reduced code duplication and better separation of concerns

## 2025-03-06: Carousel Component Refactoring

### Improved Frontend Architecture with Reusable Carousel Component
- Problem: The carousel functionality in `index.html` was complex and difficult to maintain with over 1,200 lines of code
- Root Cause:
  * All carousel functionality was embedded directly in the main HTML file
  * Duplicate code for category and lesson carousels
  * Global variables for carousel state management
  * Complex event handling logic mixed with other UI code
- Solution:
  * Created a reusable `Carousel` class in a new `app/static/js/carousel-manager.js` file with:
    - Constructor that accepts configuration options (elementId, itemCount, dataAttribute, inputId, onSelect)
    - Methods for rotation, selection, and event handling
    - Support for keyboard, button, and touch controls
    - Mobile-specific optimizations
  * Updated HTML to use the new class for both category and lesson carousels:
    ```javascript
    // Initialize category carousel
    window.categoryCarousel = new Carousel({
        elementId: 'categoryCarousel',
        itemCount: totalCategories,
        dataAttribute: 'category',
        inputId: 'storyCategory',
        onSelect: (categoryId) => {
            selectedCategory = categoryId;
        }
    });
    ```
  * Added a `setupCarouselKeyboardNavigation()` function to handle keyboard events for multiple carousels
  * Removed redundant carousel functions and global variables from the main JavaScript code
  * Updated event handlers to use the new class methods
- Result:
  * Improved code organization with carousel functionality isolated in its own module
  * Reduced duplication by using the same class for both carousels
  * Enhanced maintainability with changes to carousel behavior only needed in one place
  * Better encapsulation with carousel state managed within the class rather than using global variables
  * Cleaner HTML file with significantly reduced JavaScript code

## 2025-03-05: Added Code Complexity Analyzer Tool

### Created Development Tool for Identifying Refactoring Candidates
- Problem: Needed a way to identify files with excessive code size that might need refactoring
- Solution:
  * Created a new `tools/code_complexity_analyzer.py` utility script that:
    - Analyzes files in the repository to find those with the most lines
    - Counts total lines, non-blank lines, and code lines (excluding comments)
    - Supports filtering by file extension (e.g., `-e py js html`)
    - Allows sorting by different metrics (`-s total/non-blank/code`)
    - Provides a summary of total files and lines analyzed
  * Added comprehensive documentation with usage examples
  * Implemented comment pattern detection for Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
  * Created a dedicated `tools/` directory for development utilities
- Result:
  * Identified that `app/templates/index.html` (1,251 lines) is the largest file in the project
  * Provided a reusable tool for ongoing code quality monitoring
  * Established a pattern for organizing development utilities separate from application code

## 2025-03-05: Fixed Loading Spinner Visibility for Chapter 1

### Fixed Loading Spinner Timing and Visibility Issues
- Problem: The loading spinner was disappearing too quickly for Chapter 1 but working fine for other chapters
- Root Cause:
  * The loader was being hidden immediately after content streaming but before image generation tasks for Chapter 1 were complete
  * CSS issues with the loader
