   }
   ```

2. **Connection Management**
   ```javascript
   class WebSocketManager {

     storyLength: 10, // Fixed length
     current_chapter_number: number,
     story_choices: Array,
     correct_lesson_answers: number,
     total_lessons: number,
     all_previous_content: Array,
     lesson_responses: Array
   }
   ```

3. **Session Management**

## 2/22/2025 11:30 PM - Prompt Engineering Improvements

Made several improvements to the prompt engineering in `app/services/llm/prompt_engineering.py`:

1. **Sensory Details**: Made sensory details more flexible and optional
   - Changed "Sensory Details to Incorporate" to "Available Sensory Details"
   - Modified task instruction to "Consider incorporating sensory details where appropriate"
   - Updated critical instruction to "Consider using sensory details where they enhance the narrative"

2. **Choice Format Instructions**: Made them more concise and clearer
   - Consolidated 9 rules into 5 comprehensive points:
     1. Format: Basic structure with CHOICES tags and three choices
     2. Each choice: Line and prefix requirements
     3. Content: Quality and plot advancement
     4. Plot Twist: Progressive integration with story phases
     5. Clean Format: Technical formatting requirements
   - Removed redundant "Correct Example" since format is shown in template
   - Kept "Incorrect Examples" to demonstrate what to avoid
   - Added explicit instruction for plot twist integration in choices

3. **Plot Twist Integration**: Enhanced plot twist development
   - Added guidance for choices to relate to the unfolding plot twist
   - Progression from subtle hints to direct connections as story advances
   - Aligns with existing phase-specific plot twist guidance

These changes make the prompts more efficient while maintaining or improving their effectiveness in guiding the LLM's story generation.
