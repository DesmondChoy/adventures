## 2025-02-26: REASON Chapter Type Implementation

### Problem
The original chapter sequence had three chapter types (STORY, LESSON, CONCLUSION) with specific rules for their placement. We needed to implement a new REASON chapter type that follows LESSON chapters to test deeper understanding and ensure correct answers weren't just lucky guesses.

### Requirements
- Add a new REASON chapter type to the ChapterType enum
- Update chapter sequencing rules:
  - First chapter: STORY (changed from first two chapters)
  - Second-to-last chapter: STORY
  - Last chapter: CONCLUSION
  - 50% of remaining chapters, rounded down: LESSON
  - No consecutive LESSON chapters
  - 50% of LESSON chapters, rounded down: REASON chapters
  - REASON chapters only occur immediately after a LESSON chapter
  - STORY chapters must follow REASON chapters
  - Random selection of which LESSON chapters are followed by REASON chapters

### Solution
1. Added REASON chapter type to ChapterType enum in `app/models/story.py`
2. Updated `determine_chapter_types()` in `app/services/chapter_manager.py` to implement the new rules:
   - Changed first two chapters rule to just first chapter
   - Added logic to prevent consecutive LESSON chapters
   - Added logic to randomly select which LESSON chapters are followed by REASON chapters
   - Ensured REASON chapters are only placed after LESSON chapters
   - Ensured STORY chapters follow REASON chapters
   - Implemented trimming logic to maintain the total chapter count

3. Implemented `build_reason_chapter_prompt()` in `app/services/llm/prompt_engineering.py`:
   - For correct answers: Tests confidence without revealing the answer was correct
   - For incorrect answers: Provides a learning opportunity with explanation
   - Added diverse storytelling techniques for reflective moments
   - Structured choices to test true understanding (1 correct, 2 incorrect)

4. Updated tests in `tests/simulations/test_chapter_type_assignment.py` to validate the new rules:
   - No consecutive LESSON chapters
   - REASON chapters only follow LESSON chapters
   - STORY chapters follow REASON chapters
   - 50% of LESSON chapters (rounded down) are followed by REASON chapters

### Results
The implementation successfully:
1. Adds the new REASON chapter type with appropriate sequencing rules
2. Creates a more sophisticated educational experience by testing deeper understanding
3. Maintains the total chapter count while accommodating the new chapter type
4. Provides different approaches for correct vs. incorrect previous answers
5. Uses varied storytelling techniques to keep reflective moments engaging

## 2025-02-25: Final Chapter Sequence Testing Implementation

### Problem
The Final Chapter Sequence (from `app/services/chapter_manager.py`) was not being captured in the logs when running simulation tests, making it difficult to validate that the actual chapter types matched the planned sequence.

### Solution
1. Modified `get_chapter_sequence` function in `log_utils.py` to first check if a Final Chapter Sequence exists in the log file using the `get_final_chapter_sequence` function, and if it does, use that sequence instead of trying to extract it from other log entries.

2. Created a new test file `test_chapter_type_assignment.py` with three comprehensive tests:
   - `test_chapter_type_assignment_consistency`: Verifies that the planned chapter types match the actual chapter types used in the simulation
   - `test_chapter_type_assignment_rules`: Validates that the chapter type assignment follows all the required rules (first two chapters are STORY, last is CONCLUSION, etc.)
   - `test_extract_chapter_manager_logic`: Directly extracts and validates the chapter sequence from the log file

### Results
All tests are now passing, confirming that:
1. The Final Chapter Sequence is properly captured in the logs
2. The actual chapter types match the planned sequence
3. The chapter type assignment follows all the required rules

This implementation allows for reliable comparison of the Final Chapter Sequence against the actual ChapterType assignments in tests.
