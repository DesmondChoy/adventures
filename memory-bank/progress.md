### 2025-07-18: Streaming Delay Bug Investigation - MULTI-PHASE FIX IN PROGRESS

**üîß STREAMING DELAY BUG - PHASES 1+2 COMPLETED** with comprehensive root cause analysis and partial fix implementation.
- **Goal:** Resolve 2-5 second pause after first word streams during chapter transitions.
- **User Report:** After async optimization implementation, first word appears instantly then stalls 2-5 seconds before rest streams smoothly.
- **Investigation Method:** Deployed 3 parallel sub-agents to analyze backend streaming, frontend handling, and async optimization impact.
- **üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS:**
  - **Primary Issue:** Event loop contention between background LLM tasks and word-by-word streaming (20ms precision timing)
  - **Secondary Issue:** Character visual extraction still running synchronously (1-3 second blocking LLM call)
  - **Critical Issue:** Content generation collecting entire LLM response before streaming begins (1-3 second delay)
- **‚úÖ PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTED - Background Task Deferral:**
  - **Modified Files:**
    - `app/models/story.py` (added deferred_summary_tasks field for task factories)
    - `app/services/websocket/choice_processor.py` (converted immediate tasks to deferred task factories)
    - `app/services/websocket/stream_handler.py` (added execute_deferred_summary_tasks function)
  - **Implementation:** Background summary tasks now start AFTER streaming completes instead of competing during streaming
  - **Impact:** Eliminated event loop contention during precision streaming timing
- **‚úÖ PHASE 2 IMPLEMENTED - Character Visual Deferral:**
  - **Modified Files:**
    - `app/services/websocket/choice_processor.py` (added _update_character_visuals_background wrapper, deferred visual extraction)
  - **Implementation:** Character visual extraction (1-3s LLM call) now runs in background after streaming
  - **Impact:** Eliminated synchronous blocking operation before streaming starts
- **üìã PHASE 3 DOCUMENTED - Content Generation Streaming Fix:**
  - **Problem Identified:** `content_generator.py:172-178` collects entire LLM response before streaming (defeats streaming purpose)
  - **Solution Designed:** Stream directly from LLM without intermediate collection
  - **Implementation Plan:** Comprehensive documentation in `wip/async_chapter_summary_optimization.md`
  - **Files to Modify:** `stream_handler.py` (~100 lines), `choice_processor.py` (~50 lines)
  - **Expected Impact:** Eliminate 1-3 second content generation delay, resolve 2-5 second streaming pause
- **Current Status:** Phases 1+2 completed but streaming delay persists due to content generation blocking
- **Next Step:** Phase 3 implementation ready with detailed technical specifications

**‚úÖ CHAPTER LOADING PERFORMANCE INVESTIGATION COMPLETED** through Oracle AI advisor and parallel sub-agent analysis.
- **Goal:** Analyze chapter loading performance bottlenecks and create optimization plan to reduce loading times from 8-15 seconds to 1-3 seconds.
- **Investigation Method:** Used Oracle AI advisor and 4 parallel sub-agents to comprehensively analyze different aspects of the chapter loading process.
- **Major Performance Bottlenecks Identified:**
  - **Word-by-word streaming**: 6-12 seconds with artificial 20ms delays per word + 300-600 WebSocket frames per chapter
  - **Sequential LLM operations**: 5-10 seconds blocking (chapter summary ‚Üí character visuals ‚Üí new chapter content)
  - **Synchronous chapter summary generation**: 1-3 seconds blocking next chapter generation (CRITICAL FINDING)
  - **Multiple database writes**: 200-600ms per chapter with full state serialization
  - **Frontend JSON parsing failures**: Thousands of exceptions per chapter from failed JSON.parse() attempts
- **‚úÖ CRITICAL DISCOVERY:** Chapter summary generation is currently BLOCKING next chapter generation despite being non-critical (only used for final summary screen)
- **‚úÖ PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS COMPLETED:** Identified multiple optimization opportunities (analysis findings only)
- **‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION DOCUMENT:** Created `wip/async_chapter_summary_optimization.md` with detailed steps for async chapter summary optimization
- **User-Approved Optimization:** Implement async chapter summary generation using asyncio.create_task()
- **Expected Impact:** 1-3 second improvement from making chapter summary async (20-30% faster)
- **Files Analyzed:**

### 2025-07-15: Mobile Auto-Scroll Fix - CONSISTENT UX BEHAVIOR ACHIEVED

**‚úÖ MOBILE SCROLLING INCONSISTENCY RESOLVED** through targeted auto-scroll mechanism removal.
- **Goal:** Fix inconsistent auto-scroll behavior during story streaming on mobile devices.
- **User Experience Problem:** During story streaming, sometimes the screen would automatically scroll down, sometimes it wouldn't, creating unpredictable and jarring user experience.
- **Root Cause Investigation:**
  - **HTML Structure Analysis:** `storyContainer` (outer with `overflow: hidden`) contains `storyContent` (inner text div)
  - **Scroll Element Mismatch:** Auto-scroll code was applying `storyContent.scrollTop = storyContent.scrollHeight` but `storyContent` wasn't the actual scrollable element
  - **Mobile Behavior:** On mobile, the scrollable element is typically the window or document body, not the content div
  - **Inconsistent Results:** `storyContent.scrollTop` doesn't work reliably when `storyContent` itself isn't scrollable
- **‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:**
  - **Initial Fix:** Changed to `window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight)` to use correct scrollable element
  - **Final Decision:** User preferred no auto-scroll behavior, so disabled scroll code entirely
  - **Result:** Window now stays in place during story streaming, giving users full control over reading pace
- **‚úÖ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
  - **Location:** Modified `appendStoryText` function in `app/static/js/uiManager.js` line 566
  - **Change:** Commented out auto-scroll code with descriptive comment explaining the decision
  - **Impact:** Eliminated all unexpected scrolling behavior during streaming on any device
- **Files Modified:**
  - `app/static/js/uiManager.js` (disabled auto-scroll in appendStoryText function)
- **User Experience Impact:**
  - **Consistent Behavior:** No more unpredictable scrolling during story streaming across all devices
  - **User Control:** Users can manually scroll to read new content at their preferred pace
  - **Mobile Friendly:** Eliminates jarring auto-scroll behavior that was inconsistent on mobile devices
- **Impact:** Resolved critical mobile UX issue, providing consistent and predictable behavior during story streaming

### 2025-07-10: Loading Phrase System - ENGAGING UX ENHANCEMENT COMPLETED

**‚úÖ LOADING EXPERIENCE TRANSFORMATION SUCCESSFUL** through Sims-inspired phrase system replacing static spinner.
- **Goal:** Replace boring triangle spinner with entertaining, humorous loading phrases to keep users engaged during chapter loading.
- **User Experience Problem:** Static spinner created boring wait time, especially during longer chapter generation periods.
- **Implementation Strategy:**
  - **Content Creation:** Developed 45 unique loading phrases across three humor categories:
    - Story-themed & Wacky: "Thickening the plot...", "Feeding plot bunnies...", "Knitting destiny sweaters..."
    - Meta-storytelling humor: "Teaching dragons proper etiquette...", "Convincing heroes to wear pants...", "Upgrading protagonist's plot armor..."
    - Technical-sounding but story-focused: "Rendering imagination particles...", "Defragmenting character backstories...", "Rebooting legendary artifacts..."
  - **Dynamic Display System:** Typewriter effect (50ms/char) + rainbow gradient animation + 5-second rotation with exclusion logic
  - **API Integration:** Created `/api/loading-phrases` endpoint serving phrases from centralized storage
  - **Visual Design:** Crimson Text font matching Learning Odyssey header, black color for rainbow gradient visibility
- **‚úÖ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
  - **Backend:** Added LOADING_PHRASES constant to `prompt_templates.py`, API endpoint in `web.py`
  - **Frontend:** Removed spinner from loader HTML, added phrase styling with rainbow gradient CSS animation
  - **JavaScript:** Implemented phrase fetching, rotation management, typewriter effect, and cleanup logic
  - **Timing Integration:** Uses existing showLoader/hideLoader functions for seamless chapter transitions

- **Files Modified:**
  - `app/services/llm/prompt_templates.py` (added 45 loading phrases)
  - `app/routers/web.py` (added API endpoint)
  - `app/templates/components/loader.html` (removed spinner, added text element)
  - `app/static/css/components.css` (phrase styling and rainbow gradient animation)
  - `app/static/js/uiManager.js` (phrase rotation and typewriter effect logic)
- **Impact:** Transformed boring loading time into entertaining experience that reinforces app's playful, story-focused brand identity

### 2025-07-05: Chapter 11 Display Issue - FULLY RESOLVED

**‚úÖ CHAPTER COUNT INCONSISTENCY COMPLETELY FIXED** through systematic backend consistency improvements.
- **Goal:** Resolve "Chapters Completed: 11" showing instead of 10 in summary screen.
- **Root Cause:** Inconsistent chapter counting logic across multiple backend methods - some filtered SUMMARY chapters, others didn't.
- **Investigation Method:** Deployed 3 parallel debugging agents to analyze backend, frontend, and data flow issues.
- **Problem Sources Identified:**
  1. `AdventureStateManager.format_adventure_summary_data()` - Line 1249: Used `len(state.chapters)` without filtering SUMMARY chapters
  2. `SummaryService.format_adventure_summary_data()` - Line 148: Error fallback case used unfiltered count
  3. Multiple duplicate implementations with different filtering approaches
- **‚úÖ FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**
  - **Backend Consistency Fix:** Added SUMMARY chapter filtering to `AdventureStateManager.format_adventure_summary_data()`
  - **Error Fallback Fix:** Updated `SummaryService.format_adventure_summary_data()` fallback to use filtered count
  - **Code Deduplication:** Ensured consistent `ChapterType.SUMMARY` filtering across all chapter counting logic
- **‚úÖ VERIFICATION COMPLETED:** Live tested and confirmed summary screen now correctly displays "Chapters Completed: 10"
- **Files Fixed:**
  - `app/services/adventure_state_manager.py` (added SUMMARY filtering to format_adventure_summary_data method)
  - `app/services/summary/service.py` (fixed fallback error case to use filtered count)
  - `app/services/summary/stats_processor.py` (already correctly filtered - no changes needed)
- **Impact:** Summary screen now consistently displays accurate chapter counts matching user-visible adventure progression

### 2025-07-01: Chapter 11 Display Cosmetic Fix - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED (SUPERCEDED BY ABOVE)

**üîß CHAPTER DISPLAY FILTERING IMPLEMENTED** to resolve minor cosmetic issue (verification needed).
- **Goal:** Fix Chapter 11 (SUMMARY) appearing in user displays when only chapters 1-10 should be visible.
- **Problem:** SUMMARY chapters are internal processing chapters but were showing in summary screen, modals, and progress indicators.
- **Implementation Strategy:**
  - **Backend Filtering:** Modified chapter processing to exclude SUMMARY chapters from user-facing displays
  - **Frontend Logic:** Updated display logic to show story length instead of SUMMARY chapter number
  - **Modal Consistency:** Fixed resume and conflict modals to exclude SUMMARY chapters from calculations
  - **Scalability:** Replaced hardcoded fallbacks with dynamic configuration
- **Files Modified:**
  1. **app/services/summary/chapter_processor.py**: Added filtering to exclude SUMMARY chapters from user display processing
  2. **app/static/js/uiManager.js**: Fixed displaySummaryComplete() to show story length (10) instead of SUMMARY chapter (11)
  3. **app/routers/web.py**: Updated calculate_display_chapter_number() to filter SUMMARY chapters from modal displays
- **Note:** This initial fix addressed part of the issue but missed the inconsistent backend counting logic resolved on 2025-07-05

### 2025-07-01: AGENT.md Enhancement - CRITICAL RULES INTEGRATION COMPLETED

**üìö COMPREHENSIVE RULE INTEGRATION SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED** for future session consistency.
- **Goal:** Integrate critical implementation patterns from `.clinerules` into AGENT.md for immediate context availability.

- **‚úÖ RESULT:** Future sessions will have immediate access to critical implementation patterns
- **Impact:** Enhanced development consistency and reduced risk of violating core architectural principles

### 2025-06-30: Summary Screen Data Integrity Investigation - MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH ACHIEVED

**üéâ SUMMARY CORRUPTION SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVED** through systematic debugging and comprehensive fixes.
- **Goal:** Resolve summary screen showing incorrect data after a complete 10-chapter adventure.
- **Root Cause Discovered:** State corruption occurring AFTER successful summary generation due to problematic "bandaid" functions added in March 2025
- **Original Problems Identified:**
  1. **Chapter Count Discrepancy**: Shows "9 Chapters Completed" instead of correct 10
  2. **Educational Content Loss**: Shows generic placeholder questions instead of actual LESSON chapter questions  
  3. **State Overwrite**: Good 11-chapter state gets overwritten by corrupted 9-chapter state during summary display
- **Investigation Method:** 
  - **5 parallel sub-agents** deployed to investigate different aspects of the issue
  - **Comprehensive logging** added throughout adventure flow to trace exact corruption sequence
  - **Git history analysis** revealed `process_stored_chapter_summaries` was recent problematic addition (March 23, 2025)
- **Major Fixes Implemented:**
  1. **REMOVED** `process_stored_chapter_summaries()` function causing state corruption during read operations
  2. **REMOVED** `process_stored_lesson_questions()` calls during storage operations  
  3. **DISABLED** summary/question generation during state reconstruction (made reconstruction read-only)
  4. **DISABLED** REST API fallback in frontend that was sending corrupted localStorage data
- **‚úÖ ADDITIONAL CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:**
  1. **localStorage Corruption Source Fixed** - Removed hardcoded `chapter_type: 'story'` in `app/static/js/main.js:82`
  2. **WebSocket Timeout Logic Fixed** - Eliminated problematic 5-second timeout fallback that overwrote database state
  3. **Type Comparison Bug Fixed** - Fixed enum vs string comparison in `app/services/adventure_state_manager.py:747`
  4. **Frontend Syntax Error Fixed** - Resolved carousel-manager.js export conflict preventing choices
  5. **Chapter Creation Corruption Fixed** - Implemented corruption detection and repair system
  6. **Comprehensive Debugging Tools Created** - localStorage monitor, state corruption detector, debug dashboard

- **üéØ FINAL RESOLUTION STATUS:**
  - ‚úÖ **Knowledge questions now extract correctly** from lesson chapters 
  - ‚úÖ **localStorage corruption eliminated** - no longer overwrites good database state
  - ‚úÖ **Summary generation works reliably** via proper WebSocket flow
  - ‚úÖ **Choice functionality restored** after syntax error fix
  - ‚úÖ **Root corruption sources identified and fixed**
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Minor cosmetic issue remaining**: Chapter 11 (SUMMARY) shows in display (should only show 1-10)
  - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Separate issue identified**: WebSocket connectivity timeouts during long chapter generation

- **üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL LESSONS LEARNED:**
  1. **Read operations must be truly read-only** - Summary display should never modify or save state
  2. **"Bandaid" functions are dangerous** - Defensive programming can corrupt valid data
  3. **localStorage/database sync is critical** - Frontend state corruption can overwrite good server data
  4. **Comprehensive logging is essential** - Without detailed tracing, this corruption would have been impossible to debug
  5. **Multi-agent debugging is powerful** - Parallel investigation of different aspects accelerated resolution

### 2025-06-28: Frontend UX Accuracy Improvements
- **Goal:** Eliminate misleading elements in landing page that created false expectations about app functionality.
- **Problems Identified:**
  1. **Orphaned Landing Page File:** `app/static/landing/index.html` existed but wasn't served, contained outdated Unsplash image
  2. **Misleading Marketing Copy:** "Face puzzles and challenges" didn't accurately describe the adaptive learning approach
  3. **Fake Interactive Preview:** Mock UI showing clickable choices and complete text contradicted actual word-by-word streaming experience
- **Solutions Implemented:**
  - **Removed Orphaned File:** Deleted unused `app/static/landing/index.html` that could cause confusion
  - **Updated Marketing Copy:** Changed "Face puzzles and challenges that reinforce learning" to "Learn through choices - when you make mistakes, the story adapts to correct misunderstandings"
  - **Removed Misleading Preview:** Completely removed the "Adventure Preview" section showing fake interactive UI and all navigation links to it
- **Technical Changes:**
  - Deleted `app/static/landing/index.html` (not served by any route)
  - Modified `app/templates/pages/login.html`: Updated Interactive Challenges description
  - Modified `app/templates/pages/login.html`: Removed entire preview section (70+ lines) and navigation links
- **Result:** Landing page now accurately represents the streaming-based, adaptive learning experience without setting false expectations.
- **Impact:** Critical UX alignment ensuring users understand the actual app functionality before starting their adventure.

### 2025-06-26: Landing Page Visual Accuracy Improvement
- **Goal:** Replace misleading hero image with accurate representation of the app's text-based functionality.
- **Problem:** Original Unsplash forest image suggested a graphical game experience, but the app is primarily text-based storytelling with word-by-word streaming and choice buttons, creating false user expectations.
- **Solution:** Generated custom magical library portal image using AI text-to-image model that accurately represents the concept of "learning through adventures":
  - Shows scholarly library setting with floating text and words swirling toward a magical portal
  - Includes educational elements (globe, maps, open books with glowing text)
  - Represents books/reading as the gateway to adventure (metaphorically accurate)
  - Maintains fantasy appeal while being truthful about text-based interaction
- **Technical Implementation:**
  - Added `learning-adventure-library.png` to `app/static/images/` directory
  - Updated `app/templates/pages/login.html` to use new image path
  - Removed overlay text box that was obscuring the image
  - Removed white border (`glass` class and padding) for better visual integration
- **Image Prompt Used:** "An enchanted library captured in a sophisticated medium shot with warm, cinematic lighting... [detailed prompt focusing on floating text, educational elements, and portal metaphor]"
- **Result:** Landing page now accurately represents the app's text-based educational adventure experience without misleading users about functionality.
- **Impact:** Critical UX improvement ensuring user expectations align with actual app functionality, reducing confusion upon login.

### 2025-05-28: Chapter Numbering Display Fix - FULLY RESOLVED
- **Goal:** Resolve chapter numbering timing issues where chapters displayed incorrect numbers during streaming and final chapter showed wrong numbering.
- **Problems Identified:**
  1. **Chapter timing during streaming**: Chapter numbers updated AFTER streaming completed instead of immediately when streaming began
  2. **Final chapter special case**: Chapter 10 showed "Chapter 9 of 10" instead of "Chapter 10 of 10" due to different code path that bypassed `chapter_update` message
  3. **Regression during fix**: Initial fix caused +1 offset making Chapter 1 show as "Chapter 2 of 10"
- **Root Causes Discovered:**
  - **Normal chapters (1-9)**: `chapter_update` message sent AFTER text streaming instead of BEFORE
  - **Final chapter (10)**: Used `send_story_complete()` flow which never called `send_chapter_data()` to send `chapter_update` message  
  - **Calculation error**: Used `len(state.chapters) + 1` after chapter was already appended, causing off-by-one errors
- **Three-Part Solution Implemented:**
  1. **Fixed chapter timing** (`app/services/websocket/stream_handler.py`): Moved `send_chapter_data()` call BEFORE `stream_text_content()` 
  2. **Fixed final chapter** (`app/services/websocket/core.py`): Added `chapter_update` message to `send_story_complete()` function
  3. **Fixed calculation** (`app/services/websocket/stream_handler.py`): Use explicit `state.chapters[-1].chapter_number` instead of recalculating with state length
- **Debugging Journey:** 6-phase investigation including Git history analysis, code path divergence hunting, and legacy code pattern discovery
- **Files Updated:**
  - `app/services/websocket/stream_handler.py` (timing and calculation fixes)
  - `app/services/websocket/core.py` (final chapter fix)
  - `wip/chapter_numbering_display_fix.md` (comprehensive documentation)
- **Result:** All chapters now display correct numbering immediately when choices are made. Chapter 1 shows "Chapter 1 of 10", final chapter shows "Chapter 10 of 10", and image generation syncs properly with chapter numbers.
- **Impact:** Critical UX improvement ensuring consistent and immediate chapter numbering feedback throughout the entire adventure experience.

### 2025-05-27: Production OAuth Redirect Fix
- **Goal:** Resolve critical "localhost refused to connect" errors preventing mobile users from accessing the carousel screen after Google authentication.
- **Problem:** After Google OAuth completion, users were redirected to localhost URLs instead of the production domain, causing connection failures on mobile devices and "loading user status..." issues.
- **Root Cause:** JavaScript authentication handlers used relative URLs (e.g., `/select`) which were interpreted as `localhost/select` instead of the production domain `https://learning-odyssey.up.railway.app/select` due to browser context issues after OAuth.
- **Solution:** Replaced all relative URL redirects with absolute URLs using `window.location.origin`:
  - Updated `redirectToSelectPage()` function in `app/templates/pages/login.html`
  - Fixed all 4 redirect locations in `app/static/js/authManager.js` error handlers and logout function
  - Fixed both authentication success redirects in `app/static/landing/index.html`
  - Replaced instances of `window.location.href = '/select'` with `window.location.href = window.location.origin + '/select'`
- **Files Updated:**
  - `app/templates/pages/login.html` (modified)
  - `app/static/js/authManager.js` (modified) 
  - `app/static/landing/index.html` (modified)
- **Result:** Google OAuth now correctly redirects to production domain in all environments. Mobile users can successfully complete authentication and access the carousel screen without localhost connection errors.
- **Impact:** Critical production stability fix ensuring cross-environment compatibility for authentication flow.

### 2025-05-26: TelemetryService Railway Deployment Fix
- **Goal:** Resolve critical Railway deployment error preventing application startup.
- **Problem:** `TelemetryService` was being instantiated at module-level during import, causing "Supabase URL or Service Key not configured" error on Railway startup.
- **Root Cause:** Module-level instantiation occurred before Railway environment variables were available during the application startup process.
- **Solution:** Implemented lazy instantiation pattern across all affected files:
  - Replaced `telemetry_service = TelemetryService()` with lazy loading functions
  - Added `get_telemetry_service()` functions that instantiate only when needed
  - Updated all telemetry logging calls to use the lazy instantiation pattern
- **Files Updated:**
  - `app/services/websocket/stream_handler.py` (lazy instantiation implemented)
  - `app/services/websocket/choice_processor.py` (lazy instantiation implemented)
  - `app/routers/websocket_router.py` (lazy instantiation implemented)
  - `app/routers/summary_router.py` (lazy instantiation implemented)
- **Result:** Railway deployment error resolved - TelemetryService now instantiates successfully after environment variables are loaded.
- **Impact:** Application can now deploy and run successfully on Railway with full telemetry functionality.

### 2025-05-26: Carousel Functionality Fix
- **Goal:** Restore carousel functionality that was broken after the JavaScript refactoring.
- **Problem:** The carousel screen where users select adventure and lesson topics was not working - clicking arrows did not rotate the carousel images.
- **Root Cause:** ES6 module refactoring broke carousel initialization due to missing imports, configuration overwrite, and incorrect module loading order.
- **Tasks Completed:**
    - Fixed module loading order in `app/templates/components/scripts.html` to load `carousel-manager.js` before `main.js`.
    - Added proper ES6 imports for `Carousel` and `setupCarouselKeyboardNavigation` in `main.js` and `uiManager.js`.
    - Fixed configuration preservation by preventing `window.appConfig` overwrite in `main.js`.
    - Added ES6 exports to `carousel-manager.js` while maintaining global availability for onclick handlers.
    - Enhanced error handling and fallback initialization.
- **Affected Files:**
    - `app/templates/components/scripts.html` (modified)
    - `app/static/js/main.js` (modified)
    - `app/static/js/uiManager.js` (modified)

    - Ensured `user_id` (extracted from JWT `sub` claim) is correctly converted to a UUID object and stored in `connection_data`.
    - Removed temporary debug `print()` statements from `websocket_router.py`, transitioning to standard logging.
- **Database Interaction Fixes:**
    - Resolved `TypeError: Object of type UUID is not JSON serializable` in `app/services/state_storage_service.py` by ensuring `user_id` is converted to a string before database insertion/update in the `store_state` method.
    - Corrected `NULL` `user_id` issue in the `telemetry_events` table for `choice_made` and `chapter_viewed` events. This involved updating `app/services/websocket/choice_processor.py` and `app/services/websocket/stream_handler.py` to correctly pass the `user_id` from `connection_data` to the `TelemetryService`.
- **Google Login Flow Testing:**
    - Successfully tested the Google Login flow.
    - Verified that `user_id` is correctly populated as a string in both the `adventures` table (via `StateStorageService`) and the `telemetry_events` table (for `adventure_started`, `chapter_viewed`, and `choice_made` events).
- **Documentation:** Updated `wip/supabase_integration.md` to reflect these fixes and the successful test of the Google Login flow.

### 2025-05-21: Supabase Integration - Phase 3 (Telemetry) Fully Completed
