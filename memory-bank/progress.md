## 2025-02-28: Lesson Chapter Prompt Improvement with Story Object Method

### Problem
The lesson chapter generation prompt had several issues:
1. The narrative often didn't explicitly reference the question being asked, making it difficult for users to answer correctly
2. The thematic bridge between the story world and educational content felt forced and disconnected
3. The instructions were overly complex and difficult for the LLM to follow consistently

### Requirements
- Ensure the exact question is included verbatim in the narrative
- Create a more intuitive way to bridge between the story world and educational questions
- Simplify the instructions for better LLM comprehension
- Allow more flexibility in where the question appears in the narrative

### Solution
1. Condensed the CRITICAL RULES to three succinct points in `prompt_templates.py`:
   ```markdown
   # CRITICAL RULES
   1. NEVER mention any answer options in your narrative, but DO include the exact question "[Core Question]" verbatim somewhere in the story.
   2. Create ONE visually interesting story object (artifact, phenomenon, pattern, or map) that naturally connects to the question and makes it relevant to the character's journey.
   3. Make the question feel like a natural part of the story world, with clear stakes for why answering it matters to the characters.
   ```

2. Implemented the "Story Object Method" for creating narrative bridges:
   ```markdown
   ## Narrative Bridge - The Story Object Method
   1. Identify ONE story object or element that can naturally connect to the [Core Question]:
      - For historical questions: Something that preserves or reveals the past
      - For scientific questions: Something that demonstrates or relates to natural phenomena
      - For mathematical questions: Something involving patterns, quantities, or relationships
      - For geographical questions: Something that represents places or spatial relationships

   2. Make this story element:
      - Visually interesting (describe how it appears in the story world)
      - Relevant to the plot (connect it to the character's journey)
      - Mysterious or incomplete (create a reason to seek the answer)

   3. Include the exact question "[Core Question]" somewhere in the narrative:
      - It can be in dialogue, a character's thoughts, or written text within the story
      - The question should feel natural in context
      - The narrative should build toward this question, making it feel important
   ```

3. Modified the `_build_chapter_prompt` function in `prompt_engineering.py` to replace the [Core Question] placeholder with the actual question:
   ```python
   {LESSON_CHAPTER_INSTRUCTIONS.replace("[Core Question]", f'"{lesson_question["question"]}"')}
   ```

4. Updated the USER_PROMPT_TEMPLATE to be consistent with the new approach:
   ```markdown
   # CRITICAL RULES
   For LESSON chapters: Include the exact question verbatim, but NEVER mention any answer options.
   ```

### Results
The implementation successfully:
1. Ensures the exact question appears verbatim in the narrative so users know what they're being asked
2. Creates a more intuitive approach using a single concrete story object as the bridge
3. Provides more flexibility in where the question can appear for more natural narrative flow
4. Simplifies the instructions for better LLM comprehension
5. Maintains the core requirement that answer options are never mentioned

This approach should result in lesson chapters that feel more organic and integrated while still clearly presenting the educational question to the user.

## 2025-02-27: Phase-Specific Choice Instructions Implementation

### Problem
The choice format instructions in the Learning Odyssey application included guidance about plot twists in all story phases, including the Exposition phase. However, according to the plot twist development pattern, plot twist elements should only be introduced starting from the Rising phase, not in the Exposition phase.

### Requirements
- Ensure plot twist guidance only appears in appropriate phases (Rising, Trials, Climax)
- Create phase-specific choice instructions for each story phase
- Maintain consistent format and structure across all phases
- Implement a clean, maintainable solution that integrates with existing systems
- Create a test script to verify the implementation

### Solution
1. Modified `prompt_templates.py` to implement phase-specific choice instructions:
   ```python
   # Base choice format (common elements for all phases)
   BASE_CHOICE_FORMAT = """# Choice Format
   Use this EXACT format for the choices, with NO indentation and NO line breaks within choices:
   
   <CHOICES>
   Choice A: [First choice description]
   Choice B: [Second choice description]
   Choice C: [Third choice description]
   </CHOICES>
   
   ## Rules
   1. Format: Start and end with <CHOICES> tags on their own lines, with exactly three choices
   2. Each choice: Begin with "Choice [A/B/C]: " and contain the complete description on a single line
   3. Content: Make each choice meaningful, distinct, and advance the plot in interesting ways"""
   
   # Phase-specific choice guidance
   CHOICE_PHASE_GUIDANCE: Dict[str, str] = {
       "Exposition": "4. Character Establishment: Choices should reveal character traits and establish initial direction",
       "Rising": "4. Plot Development: Choices should subtly hint at the emerging plot twist",
       "Trials": "4. Challenge Response: Choices should show different approaches to mounting challenges",
       "Climax": "4. Critical Decision: Choices should represent pivotal decisions with significant consequences",
       "Return": "4. Resolution: Choices should reflect the character's growth and transformation"
   }
   
   def get_choice_instructions(phase: str) -> str:
       """Get the appropriate choice instructions for a given story phase."""
       base = BASE_CHOICE_FORMAT
       phase_guidance = CHOICE_PHASE_GUIDANCE.get(phase, CHOICE_PHASE_GUIDANCE["Rising"])
       return f"{base}\n\n{phase_guidance}"
   
   # Keep the original for backward compatibility
   CHOICE_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = get_choice_instructions("Rising")
   ```

2. Updated `prompt_engineering.py` to use the new phase-specific instructions:
   ```python
   # In the imports section, added:
   from app.services.llm.prompt_templates import get_choice_instructions
   
   # In _build_chapter_prompt function, replaced:
   {CHOICE_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS}
   
   # With:
   {get_choice_instructions(story_phase)}
   
   # Also updated build_user_prompt function similarly
   ```

3. Created a test script `app/services/llm/test_phase_choice_instructions.py` to verify the implementation:
   - Tests each phase to ensure it gets the appropriate choice instructions
   - Verifies that the plot twist guidance only appears in Rising, Trials, and Climax phases
   - Confirms that the fallback behavior works correctly for unknown phases

### Results
The implementation successfully:
1. Ensures plot twist guidance only appears in appropriate phases (Rising, Trials, Climax)
2. Provides phase-appropriate guidance for each story phase:
   - Exposition: Focus on character establishment
   - Rising: Subtle hints at the plot twist
   - Trials: Different approaches to challenges
   - Climax: Pivotal decisions with consequences
   - Return: Character growth and transformation
3. Maintains consistent format and structure across all phases
4. Integrates cleanly with the existing prompt engineering system
5. Provides backward compatibility through the original CHOICE_FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS constant
6. Verifies correct behavior through comprehensive testing

## 2025-02-27: LLM Prompt Optimization with Markdown Structure

### Problem
The LLM prompts in the Learning Odyssey application were lengthy and not optimally structured, making them harder to parse for both humans and the LLM. Additionally, there was a formatting issue in the continuity guidance section that was causing empty bullet points when there was only one previous lesson.

### Requirements
- Restructure LLM prompts to be more organized and readable
- Create a clear visual hierarchy with markdown headings and subheadings
- Enhance formatting for lesson answers and lesson history
- Fix the continuity guidance formatting issue
- Create a test script to verify the new prompt structure
- Improve the overall clarity and effectiveness of prompts for all chapter types

### Solution
1. Restructured the system prompt and user prompt templates in `app/services/llm/prompt_templates.py` to use markdown headings and formatting
2. Enhanced the formatting of lesson answers and lesson history in `app/services/llm/prompt_engineering.py`
3. Fixed the continuity guidance formatting issue in `build_user_prompt()` by using a more robust approach:
   ```python
   additional_guidance = ""
   if num_previous_lessons > 0:
       guidance_points = ["Build on the consequences of the previous lesson"]
       if num_previous_lessons > 1:
           guidance_points.append("Show how previous lessons have impacted the character")
       
       formatted_points = "\n".join([f"{i+1}. {point}" for i, point in enumerate(guidance_points)])
       additional_guidance = f"## Continuity Guidance\n{formatted_points}"
   ```
4. Created a test script `app/services/llm/test_prompt.py` to verify the new prompt structure
5. Improved the overall clarity and effectiveness of prompts for all chapter types

### Results
The implementation successfully:
1. Created a more organized and readable prompt structure using markdown
2. Established a clear visual hierarchy with headings and subheadings
3. Enhanced the formatting of lesson answers and lesson history
4. Fixed the continuity guidance formatting issue
5. Verified the new prompt structure with a test script
6. Improved the overall clarity and effectiveness of prompts for all chapter types

## 2025-02-27: Chapter Sequence Optimization Tradeoff

### Problem
The chapter sequence algorithm needed to prioritize certain rules over others, particularly ensuring no consecutive LESSON chapters and at least 1 REASON chapter in every scenario, while allowing some flexibility in the number of LESSON chapters.

### Requirements
- Prioritize no consecutive LESSON chapters as the highest rule
- Ensure at least 1 REASON chapter in every scenario
- Assume every LESSON has at least 3 questions available
- Accept 25% of scenarios where there are two LESSON chapters (when there should be three) in the distribution

### Solution
1. Updated the validation in `check_chapter_sequence()` to prioritize checking for no consecutive LESSON chapters and at least 1 REASON chapter
2. Modified tests to verify the distribution of scenarios with 2 vs 3 LESSON chapters
3. Updated documentation to reflect the new priorities
4. Ensured the algorithm assumes at least 3 questions are available for every LESSON

### Results
The implementation successfully:
1. Maintains the priority of no consecutive LESSON chapters
2. Ensures at least 1 REASON chapter in every scenario
3. Assumes 3 questions are available for every LESSON
4. Accepts a small percentage (25%) of scenarios with 2 LESSON chapters as an optimization tradeoff

## 2025-02-27: Enhanced REASON Chapter Challenge Type Tracking

### Problem
The `build_reason_chapter_prompt()` function in `app/services/llm/prompt_engineering.py` was improved to add variety to correct answer handling with different challenge types (confidence_test, application, connection_making, teaching_moment), but there was no way to track which challenge type was being used for debugging and analysis purposes.

### Requirements
- Remove unused `all_answers` line in the function
- Implement varied approach for correct answers with different challenge types
- Restructure incorrect answer handling with a more educational approach
- Add tracking of the selected challenge type in the AdventureState metadata

### Solution
1. Removed the unused `all_answers = [answer["text"] for answer in lesson_question["answers"]]` line
2. Enhanced the function to randomly select from four different challenge types for correct answers:
   - `confidence_test`: Original implementation that tests if they'll stick with their answer
   - `application`: Tests if they can apply the concept in a new scenario
   - `connection_making`: Tests if they can connect the concept to broader themes
   - `teaching_moment`: Tests if they can explain the concept to someone else
3. Restructured incorrect answer handling with a more educational approach:
   - Educational reflection: Gently revealing the correct concept
   - Narrative deepening: Using the story environment to illustrate the concept
   - "Aha moment": Creating a moment where understanding clicks
   - Story-integrated choices: Testing understanding while advancing the story
4. Added challenge type tracking in AdventureState metadata:
   - Added an optional `state: Optional[AdventureState]` parameter to the function
   - Added code to track the challenge type in metadata when state is provided
   - Created a structured history in `state.metadata["reason_challenge_history"]`
   - Stored the most recent challenge type in `state.metadata["last_reason_challenge_type"]`
   - Added debug logging for the selected challenge type
5. Updated `_build_chapter_prompt()` to pass the state parameter to `build_reason_chapter_prompt()`

### Results
The implementation successfully:
1. Provides more varied and engaging REASON chapters with different challenge types
2. Tracks the selected challenge type in the AdventureState metadata for debugging
3. Offers both detailed history and quick access to challenge type information
4. Improves the educational experience with a more structured approach for incorrect answers
5. Maintains compatibility with the existing system by making the state parameter optional

## 2025-02-26: REASON Chapter Type Implementation

### Problem
The original chapter sequence had three chapter types (STORY, LESSON, CONCLUSION) with specific rules for their placement. We needed to implement a new REASON chapter type that follows LESSON chapters to test deeper understanding and ensure correct answers weren't just lucky guesses.

### Requirements
- Add a new REASON chapter type to the ChapterType enum
- Update chapter sequencing rules:
  - First chapter: STORY (changed from first two chapters)
  - Second-to-last chapter: STORY
  - Last chapter: CONCLUSION
  - 50% of remaining chapters, rounded down: LESSON
  - No consecutive LESSON chapters
  - 50% of LESSON chapters, rounded down: REASON chapters
  - REASON chapters only occur immediately after a LESSON chapter
  - STORY chapters must follow REASON chapters
  - Random selection of which LESSON chapters are followed by REASON chapters

### Solution
1. Added REASON chapter type to ChapterType enum in `app/models/story.py`
2. Updated `determine_chapter_types()` in `app/services/chapter_manager.py` to implement the new rules:
   - Changed first two chapters rule to just first chapter
   - Added logic to prevent consecutive LESSON chapters
   - Added logic to randomly select which LESSON chapters are followed by REASON chapters
   - Ensured REASON chapters are only placed after LESSON chapters
   - Ensured STORY chapters follow REASON chapters
   - Implemented trimming logic to maintain the total chapter count

3. Implemented `build_reason_chapter_prompt()` in `app/services/llm/prompt_engineering.py`:
   - For correct answers: Tests confidence without revealing the answer was correct
   - For incorrect answers: Provides a learning opportunity with explanation
   - Added diverse storytelling techniques for reflective moments
   - Structured choices to test true understanding (1 correct, 2 incorrect)

4. Updated tests in `tests/simulations/test_chapter_type_assignment.py` to validate the new rules:
   - No consecutive LESSON chapters
   - REASON chapters only follow LESSON chapters
   - STORY chapters follow REASON chapters
   - 50% of LESSON chapters (rounded down) are followed by REASON chapters

### Results
The implementation successfully:
1. Adds the new REASON chapter type with appropriate sequencing rules
2. Creates a more sophisticated educational experience by testing deeper understanding
3. Maintains the total chapter count while accommodating the new chapter type
4. Provides different approaches for correct vs. incorrect previous answers
5. Uses varied storytelling techniques to keep reflective moments engaging

## 2025-02-25: Final Chapter Sequence Testing Implementation

### Problem
The Final Chapter Sequence (from `app/services/chapter_manager.py`) was not being captured in the logs when running simulation tests, making it difficult to validate that the actual chapter types matched the planned sequence.

### Solution
1. Modified `get_chapter_sequence` function in `log_utils.py` to first check if a Final Chapter Sequence exists in the log file using the `get_final_chapter_sequence` function, and if it does, use that sequence instead of trying to extract it from other log entries.

2. Created a new test file `test_chapter_type_assignment.py` with three comprehensive tests:
   - `test_chapter_type_assignment_consistency`: Verifies that the planned chapter types match the actual chapter types used in the simulation
   - `test_chapter_type_assignment_rules`: Validates that the chapter type assignment follows all the required rules (first two chapters are STORY, last is CONCLUSION, etc.)
   - `test_extract_chapter_manager_logic`: Directly extracts and validates the chapter sequence from the log file

### Results
All tests are now passing, confirming that:
1. The Final Chapter Sequence is properly captured in the logs
2. The actual chapter types match the planned sequence
3. The chapter type assignment follows all the required rules

This implementation allows for reliable comparison of the Final Chapter Sequence against the actual ChapterType assignments in tests.
