### 2025-03-25: WebSocket Services Refactoring

  - `choice_processor.py`: Processing user choices and chapter transitions
  - `content_generator.py`: Generating chapter content based on state
  - `image_generator.py`: Managing image generation for agency choices and chapters
  - `stream_handler.py`: Handling content streaming to clients
  - `summary_generator.py`: Managing summary generation and display

- Enhanced modularity for easier maintenance and future extensions

### 2025-03-25: Template System Refactoring
- Implemented a modular template system for improved frontend organization
- Created a base layout (`layouts/main_layout.html`) that extends `base.html`
- Extracted reusable UI components into separate files:
  - `components/category_carousel.html`: Story category selection carousel
  - `components/lesson_carousel.html`: Lesson topic selection carousel
  - `components/loader.html`: Loading indicator component
  - `components/scripts.html`: JavaScript includes and initialization
  - `components/stats_display.html`: Adventure statistics display
  - `components/story_container.html`: Main story content container
- Updated the main index page to use this component structure
- Improved maintainability through separation of concerns
- Enhanced code reusability through component extraction
- Simplified testing and debugging of individual components

### 2025-03-23: Summary Chapter Race Condition Fix
- Verified that the Summary Chapter race condition fix is working correctly
- Fixed Summary Chapter race condition by modifying the "Take a Trip Down Memory Lane" button functionality
- Updated `viewAdventureSummary()` function in `app/templates/index.html` to use WebSocket flow exclusively
- Fixed an issue where the WebSocket message was missing the state data, causing "Missing state in message" errors
- Modified the WebSocket message to include both state and choice data
- Implemented fallback to REST API for robustness with 5-second timeout
- Added flag to track redirects and prevent duplicate redirects
- Added detailed logging for debugging
- Created and later removed test HTML file to verify the solution after successful implementation
- Simulated various timing scenarios to ensure the race condition is eliminated
- Ensured the state stored always includes the CONCLUSION chapter summary
- Improved user experience by ensuring complete data is displayed in the Summary Chapter

### 2025-03-23: State Storage Improvements
- Fixed missing state storage issue in Summary Chapter
