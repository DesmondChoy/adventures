# Progress Log

## 2025-03-15: Separated Image Scene Generation from Chapter Summaries

### Implemented Dedicated Image Scene Generation
- Problem: The application was using chapter summaries for both narrative recaps and image generation, creating a compromise between two different needs
- Root Cause:
  * Chapter summaries needed to be comprehensive narrative overviews (30-40 words covering key events and educational content)
  * Image generation needs vivid visual scenes focused on the most dramatic or visually compelling moments (20-30 words of pure visual description)
  * Using the same text for both purposes created sub-optimal results for one or both uses
- Solution:
  * Added New Template in `prompt_templates.py`:
    - Created `IMAGE_SCENE_PROMPT` specifically for extracting the most visually compelling moment from a chapter:
      ```python
      IMAGE_SCENE_PROMPT = """Identify the single most visually striking moment from this chapter that would make a compelling illustration. 

      Focus on:
      1. A specific dramatic action or emotional peak
      2. Clear visual elements (character poses, expressions, environmental details)
      3. The moment with the most visual energy or emotional impact
      4. Elements that best represent the chapter's theme or turning point

      Describe ONLY this scene in 20-30 words using vivid, specific language. Focus purely on the visual elements and action, not narrative explanation. Do not include character names or story title.

      CHAPTER CONTENT:
      {chapter_content}

      SCENE DESCRIPTION:
      """
      ```
    - Added the new prompt to the imports in `chapter_manager.py`
  * Added New Method in `ChapterManager`:
    - Created `generate_image_scene` method that uses the new prompt to extract the most visually striking moment
    - Implemented similar structure to `generate_chapter_summary` but with different focus
    - Added robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
  * Updated WebSocket Service:
    - Modified `stream_and_send_chapter` to use `generate_image_scene` instead of `generate_chapter_summary` for image generation
    - Kept the same `enhance_prompt` mechanism to add agency, story, and visual details
- Result:
  * Chapter summaries now focus on comprehensive narrative overviews (better for SUMMARY chapter)
  * Image generation now focuses on the most visually compelling moments (better for illustrations)
  * More dynamic, exciting illustrations that capture specific dramatic moments
  * Clearer separation of concerns between the two different needs

## 2025-03-15: Removed Chapter Summary Truncation for Complete Summaries

### Removed Artificial Truncation of Chapter Summaries
- Problem: Chapter summaries were being artificially truncated to 40 words when they exceeded 50 words, causing incomplete summaries ending with "..."
- Root Cause:
  * The `generate_chapter_summary` method in `ChapterManager` had explicit truncation logic:
    ```python
    # Truncate if needed
    if len(summary.split()) > 50:
        summary = " ".join(summary.split()[:40]) + "..."
    ```
  * This was causing summaries like the one in Chapter 8 to be cut off with "Maya resolved to..."
- Solution:
  * Removed the truncation logic from the `generate_chapter_summary` method
  * Maintained the LLM prompt that still guides it to generate concise summaries
  * Kept the empty summary check and fallback mechanism
- Result:
  * Chapter summaries are now displayed in full as generated by the LLM
  * No more truncated summaries ending with "..."
  * More complete and informative chapter summaries throughout the application
  * Better context in the summary chapter where these summaries are displayed

## 2025-03-14: Improved Chapter Summaries with Narrative Focus

### Enhanced Chapter Summary Generation
- Problem: Chapter summaries were optimized for image generation (visual scenes) rather than narrative progression, making the SUMMARY chapter less cohesive and educational
- Root Cause:
  * The hardcoded prompt in `generate_chapter_summary()` was focused on "vivid visual scene" descriptions
  * Summaries excluded dialogue and abstract concepts, focusing only on visual elements
  * The 20-word limit constrained the ability to capture educational content and character development
- Solution:
  * Created New Prompt Template:
    - Added `SUMMARY_CHAPTER_PROMPT` to `app/services/llm/prompt_templates.py`:
      ```python
      SUMMARY_CHAPTER_PROMPT = """Create a concise summary of this chapter (30-40 words) that:
      1. Captures the key narrative events and character development
      2. Includes any important choices or decisions made
      3. Mentions educational content if present
      4. Can stand alone but also work as part of a sequential chapter-by-chapter recap

      The summary should be written in third person, past tense, and maintain the adventure's narrative tone.

      CHAPTER CONTENT:
      {chapter_content}

      CHAPTER SUMMARY:
      """
      ```
    - Designed the prompt to focus on narrative events, character development, and educational content
    - Increased word count guidance to 30-40 words for more comprehensive summaries
  * Updated Image Generation Service:
    - Imported the new prompt template in `app/services/image_generation_service.py`:
      ```python
      from app.services.llm.prompt_templates import SUMMARY_CHAPTER_PROMPT
      ```
    - Replaced the hardcoded visual-focused prompt with the narrative-focused template:
      ```python
      # Create a custom prompt for the chapter summary using the template
      custom_prompt = SUMMARY_CHAPTER_PROMPT.format(
          chapter_content=chapter_content
      )
      ```
    - Maintained the same LLM service call structure for compatibility
- Result:
  * Chapter summaries now capture key story events and character development
  * Summaries include important choices and educational content when present
  * Consistent third-person, past tense voice throughout all summaries
  * The SUMMARY chapter provides a more cohesive and educational recap of the adventure

## 2025-03-14: Enhanced Simulation Log Summary Viewer with Educational Questions

### Enhanced Simulation Log Summary Viewer with Educational Questions
- Problem: The `show_summary_from_log.py` script was not extracting chapter summaries from simulation logs and was showing dummy summaries instead. Additionally, educational questions encountered during the adventure were not being displayed in the Learning Report section.
- Root Causes:
  * The script wasn't properly extracting chapter content from STATE_TRANSITION events in the log file
  * No mechanism to extract educational questions from the log file
  * The AdventureState model didn't have a field to store lesson questions
- Solution:
  * Enhanced Chapter Summary Extraction:
    - Modified `extract_chapter_summaries_from_log` to extract chapter content from STATE_TRANSITION events:
      ```python
      # Also try to extract from STATE_TRANSITION events which contain chapter content
      if not all_summaries_found and "EVENT:STATE_TRANSITION" in line:
          try:
              data = json.loads(line)
              if "state" in data:
                  # The state is a JSON string that needs to be parsed again
                  state_str = data["state"]
                  state_data = json.loads(state_str)

                  # Check if this state contains chapter_summaries
                  if "chapter_summaries" in state_data and state_data["chapter_summaries"]:
                      chapter_summaries = state_data["chapter_summaries"]
                      if len(chapter_summaries) > len(summaries):
                          summaries = chapter_summaries

                  # Extract chapter content to use as fallback summaries
                  if "current_chapter" in state_data:
                      chapter_info = state_data["current_chapter"]
                      chapter_number = chapter_info.get("chapter_number")

                      # Try to get content from different possible locations
                      chapter_content = ""

                      # First try direct content field
                      if "content" in chapter_info:
                          chapter_content = chapter_info.get("content", "")

                      # If no content found, try chapter_content.content
                      if not chapter_content and "chapter_content" in chapter_info:
                          chapter_content_obj = chapter_info.get("chapter_content", {})
                          if isinstance(chapter_content_obj, dict) and "content" in chapter_content_obj:
                              chapter_content = chapter_content_obj.get("content", "")

                      if chapter_number and chapter_content:
                          # Store the first paragraph (or up to 200 chars) as a summary
                          paragraphs = chapter_content.split("\n\n")
                          if paragraphs:
                              first_paragraph = paragraphs[0].strip()
                              # Limit to 200 characters and add ellipsis if needed
                              if len(first_paragraph) > 200:
                                  first_paragraph = first_paragraph[:197] + "..."
                              chapter_contents[chapter_number] = first_paragraph
          except Exception as e:
              logger = logging.getLogger("debug_summary")
              logger.error(f"Error parsing STATE_TRANSITION: {e}")
              pass
      ```
    - Added support for different content formats (direct content field and chapter_content.content)
    - Implemented fallback to use the first paragraph of chapter content as a summary
  * Added Lesson Question Extraction:
    - Updated `extract_chapter_summaries_from_log` to extract educational questions from EVENT:LESSON_QUESTION entries:
      ```python
      # Look for lesson questions
      if "EVENT:LESSON_QUESTION" in line:
          try:
              data = json.loads(line)
              if "question" in data:
                  question = data.get("question", "")
                  topic = data.get("topic", "")
                  subtopic = data.get("subtopic", "")
                  correct_answer = data.get("correct_answer", "")

                  if question and correct_answer:
                      lesson_questions.append({
                          "question": question,
                          "topic": topic,
                          "subtopic": subtopic,
                          "correct_answer": correct_answer
                      })
          except Exception as e:
              logger = logging.getLogger("debug_summary")
              logger.error(f"Error parsing LESSON_QUESTION: {e}")
              pass
      ```
    - Modified the function to return both summaries and lesson questions:
      ```python
      return summaries, lesson_questions
      ```
    - Added a `lesson_questions` field to the AdventureState model:
      ```python
      # Lesson questions for the SUMMARY chapter
      lesson_questions: List[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(
          default_factory=list,
          description="Educational questions encountered during the adventure for display in the SUMMARY chapter",
      )
      ```
  * Improved Summary Display:
    - Updated `show_summary_from_log.py` to handle the new return value from `extract_chapter_summaries_from_log`
    - Added handling for cases with fewer than 10 summaries by adding dummy summaries for missing chapters
    - Replaced the default "You didn't encounter any educational questions" message with actual questions:
      ```python
      # If we have lesson questions, add them to the summary content
      if lesson_questions:
          # Find the Learning Report section
          learning_report_index = summary_content.find("## Learning Report")
          if learning_report_index != -1:
              # Extract everything before the Learning Report section
              before_learning_report = summary_content[: learning_report_index + len("## Learning Report")]

              # Find the default "You didn't encounter any educational questions" message
              default_message_index = summary_content.find(
                  "You didn't encounter any educational questions", learning_report_index
              )
              
              # Extract everything after the Learning Report section but before the default message
              if default_message_index != -1:
                  # Find the start of the paragraph containing the default message
                  paragraph_start = summary_content.rfind(
                      "\n\n", learning_report_index, default_message_index
                  )
                  if paragraph_start == -1:
                      paragraph_start = learning_report_index + len("## Learning Report")

                  # Find the end of the paragraph containing the default message
                  paragraph_end = summary_content.find("\n\n", default_message_index)
                  if paragraph_end == -1:
                      paragraph_end = len(summary_content)

                  # Extract content before and after the default message paragraph
                  before_default = summary_content[
                      learning_report_index + len("## Learning Report") : paragraph_start
                  ]
                  after_default = summary_content[paragraph_end:]

                  # Combine to skip the default message
                  after_learning_report = after_default
              else:
                  # If default message not found, just get everything after the Learning Report header
                  after_learning_report_index = summary_content.find(
                      "\n\n", learning_report_index
                  )
                  if after_learning_report_index == -1:
                      after_learning_report = ""
                  else:
                      after_learning_report = summary_content[
                          after_learning_report_index:
                      ]

              # Create a new Learning Report section with the lesson questions
              learning_report = "\n\nDuring your adventure, you encountered the following educational questions:\n\n"
              for i, question in enumerate(lesson_questions, 1):
                  learning_report += f"{i}. **Question**: {question['question']}\n"
                  learning_report += f"   **Topic**: {question['topic']}"
                  if question["subtopic"]:
                      learning_report += f" - {question['subtopic']}"
                  learning_report += (
                      f"\n   **Correct Answer**: {question['correct_answer']}\n\n"
                  )

              # Combine everything
              summary_content = (
                  before_learning_report + learning_report + after_learning_report
              )
      ```
- Result:
  * The script now correctly extracts chapter summaries from simulation logs
  * Educational questions are displayed in the Learning Report section
  * The summary provides a complete overview of the adventure, including both narrative and educational content
  * Works with both new and existing simulation log files

### Fixed SUMMARY Chapter Functionality
- Problem: After clicking the "Reveal Your Adventure Summary" button at the end of a 10-chapter adventure, the application showed a loading spinner but never actually loaded the summary page
- Root Causes:
  * State synchronization issue: The backend wasn't properly receiving the state from the client when processing summary requests
  * Error handling: There was no proper error handling or timeout detection in the frontend
- Solution:
  * Backend Fix in `websocket_service.py`:
    - Modified the `process_summary_request` function to properly receive and update the state from the client:
      ```python
      async def process_summary_request(state_manager, websocket):
          try:
              # Get the client's state from the request
              data = await websocket.receive_json()
              validated_state = data.get("state")

              # Update the state manager with the client's state if provided
              if validated_state:
                  logger.debug("Updating state from client for summary request")
                  state_manager.update_state_from_client(validated_state)

              # Get the current state after the update
              state = state_manager.get_current_state()
              # ... rest of the function ...
      ```
    - Added better error handling to provide more useful feedback when issues occur
  * Frontend Fix in `index.html`:
    - Enhanced the `requestSummary` function with better error handling and a timeout:
      ```javascript
      function requestSummary() {
          if (storyWebSocket && storyWebSocket.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
              showLoader();
              // Clear content and reset state
              document.getElementById('storyContent').innerHTML = '';
              document.getElementById('choicesContainer').innerHTML = '';
              streamBuffer = '';
              if (renderTimeout) {
                  clearTimeout(renderTimeout);
              }

              // Log the request for debugging
              console.log("Sending summary request to server");

              // Send request for summary
              sendMessage({
                  type: 'request_summary',
                  state: stateManager.loadState()
              });

              // Add a timeout to detect if the request is hanging
              setTimeout(() => {
                  if (document.getElementById('loaderOverlay').classList.contains('active')) {
                      console.warn("Summary request timed out after 10 seconds");
                      hideLoader();
                      showError("Summary request timed out. Please try again.");
                  }
              }, 10000);
          } else {
              showError('Connection lost. Please refresh the page.');
          }
      }
      ```
    - Added code to clear content and reset state before sending the request
    - Implemented a 10-second timeout to detect if the request is hanging
  * Created two debug scripts to test the functionality:
    - `tests/debug_summary_chapter.py` - Tests the summary content generation
    - `tests/debug_websocket_router.py` - Tests the WebSocket router handling of summary requests
- Result:
  * The "Reveal Your Adventure Summary" button now works correctly
  * Users can see the summary page after completing an adventure
  * Better error handling and user feedback if issues occur
  * Improved reliability of the summary feature

## 2025-03-11: Enhanced Summary Implementation with Progressive Chapter Summaries

### Improved SUMMARY Chapter with Progressive Chapter Summaries
- Problem: The original SUMMARY chapter implementation generated the entire summary at the end of the adventure, which could be slow and less detailed
- Solution:
  * Enhanced the AdventureState model to store chapter summaries throughout the adventure:
    - Added `chapter_summaries` field to the AdventureState model to store summaries as they're generated
    - Maintained compatibility with the existing SUMMARY chapter type
  * Modified the process_choice function to generate summaries progressively:
    - Added code to generate a chapter summary after each user choice
    - Used the existing `generate_chapter_summary` method from ImageGenerationService
    - Stored summaries in the AdventureState's chapter_summaries list
    - Added error handling to ensure the main flow continues even if summary generation fails
  * Rewrote the generate_summary_content function to use stored summaries:
    - Created a chronological recap using the stored chapter summaries
    - Preserved chapter context by showing chapter numbers and types
    - Maintained the same learning report format for educational value
    - Added fallback to the original LLM-based summary generation if no summaries are available
  * Leveraged existing infrastructure:
    - Reused the same summary generation logic that's already used for image prompts
    - Maintained backward compatibility with the existing summary functionality
    - Kept the same UI flow with the "Reveal Your Adventure Summary" button
- Technical Advantages:
  * Distributed processing - summaries generated throughout the adventure instead of all at once at the end
  * More resilient - if one chapter summary fails, others can still be displayed
  * Reduced wait time at the end of the adventure
  * Better captures "in-the-moment" details that might be lost in a retrospective summary
- User Experience Benefits:
  * More detailed visualization of the journey through each chapter
  * Clearer connections between specific chapters and learning moments
  * Faster summary generation at the end of the adventure
  * More journey-like experience showing how the story evolved

## 2025-03-10: Fixed Paragraph Formatter Bug

### Fixed Paragraph Formatter Using Incomplete Text
- Problem: Paragraph formatter was detecting text without proper paragraph formatting, but only reformatting the initial buffer instead of the full response
- Root Cause:
  * In both OpenAIService and GeminiService, when text needed formatting, the system was passing `collected_text` (initial buffer) to the reformatting function instead of `full_response` (complete text)
  * This resulted in properly formatted initial text but the remainder of the response still lacked paragraph breaks
  * Debug logs showed the detection was working, but the reformatted text wasn't being fully utilized
- Solution:
  * Modified all instances in both service classes to use `full_response` instead of `collected_text` when reformatting is needed:
    - Updated OpenAIService.generate_with_prompt
    - Updated OpenAIService.generate_chapter_stream
    - Updated GeminiService.generate_with_prompt
    - Updated GeminiService.generate_chapter_stream
  * Maintained the existing retry mechanism (up to 3 attempts with progressively stronger formatting instructions)
  * No changes were needed to the paragraph detection logic or the reformatting function itself
- Result:
  * Complete LLM responses now have proper paragraph formatting throughout the entire text
  * Improved readability for users, especially for longer responses
  * Maintained the streaming experience when formatting isn't needed
  * Fixed the issue where debug logs showed detection and reformatting but the output still lacked proper formatting

## 2025-03-10: Implemented Summary Page After CONCLUSION Chapter

### Added Summary Page Feature
- Problem: The adventure ended abruptly after the CONCLUSION chapter without a proper summary of the journey
- Solution:
  * Added a new SUMMARY chapter type to provide a recap of the adventure:
    - Updated `story.py` to add SUMMARY to the ChapterType enum
    - Modified ChapterData validation to accommodate SUMMARY chapters
    - Added a create_summary_chapter method to ChapterManager
  * Implemented backend services for summary generation:
    - Created `build_summary_chapter_prompt` function in `prompt_engineering.py` to generate prompts for the summary
    - Added `generate_summary_content` function in `websocket_service.py` to use the LLM to generate the summary content
    - Implemented `process_summary_request` function to handle summary requests from the client
  * Enhanced the frontend to support the summary page:
    - Added a "Reveal Your Adventure Summary" button at the end of the CONCLUSION chapter
    - Implemented handlers for summary-related WebSocket messages
    - Added smooth transitions between conclusion and summary pages
  * Followed architectural best practices:
    - Separated prompt engineering logic from service layer implementation
    - Used consistent naming conventions with other chapter-related functions
    - Maintained clear separation of concerns between components
- Result:
  * Users now have a satisfying conclusion to their adventure with a summary page
  * The summary includes a narrative recap of the journey and a learning report
  * Questions, answers, and explanations are displayed in an organized format
  * The implementation follows the existing architectural patterns
  * The feature enhances the educational value of the application

## 2025-03-10: Fixed Chapter Summary Generation for Image Prompts

### Fixed Chapter Summary Generation for Image Prompts
- Problem: Chapter summaries generated by the LLM weren't being included in image generation prompts
- Root Cause:
  * Mismatch between how the streaming response was being collected from different LLM providers
  * The Gemini API's streaming response wasn't being properly captured in the async for loop
  * The summary was being generated but then lost or misinterpreted as empty
- Solution:
  * Implemented service-specific handling for different LLM providers:
    - For Gemini: Used direct API call instead of streaming for summary generation
    - For OpenAI: Maintained the streaming approach which works correctly
  * Added comprehensive logging to track the raw response, its length, and processed summary
  * Enhanced empty check to consider very short summaries (less than 5 characters) as empty
  * Improved fallback mechanism to use the first paragraph of chapter content when needed
- Implementation Details:
  * Added detection of which LLM service is being used (Gemini or OpenAI)
  * Used a more robust approach to collecting chunks from streaming responses
  * Added explicit error handling with graceful fallbacks
  * Implemented detailed logging at each step of the process
- Key Learning:
  * Different LLM service providers require different implementation approaches for the same functionality
  * Streaming responses work differently between OpenAI and Gemini APIs
  * Direct API calls are more reliable than streaming for short, single-response use cases
  * Always implement robust fallback mechanisms for LLM-dependent features
- Result:
  * Chapter summaries are now properly included in image generation prompts
  * More relevant and contextual images for each chapter
  * Consistent inclusion of agency choice from Chapter 1 in all images
  * Improved reliability with better error handling and logging

## 2025-03-09: Implemented Paragraph Formatting for LLM Responses

### Enhanced Text Readability with Automatic Paragraph Formatting
- Problem: LLM responses occasionally lacked proper paragraph breaks, causing text to render as one continuous paragraph
- Root Cause:
  * Despite system prompt instructions to "Format responses with clear paragraph breaks", the LLM sometimes failed to include proper paragraph breaks
  * This resulted in a wall of text that was difficult to read, especially on mobile devices
  * The issue occurred randomly but frequently enough to impact user experience
- Solution:
  * Created a new `paragraph_formatter.py` module with functions to detect and fix text without proper paragraph formatting:
    - `needs_paragraphing()`: Detects text that needs formatting based on length, existing paragraph breaks, sentence count, and dialogue markers
    - `reformat_text_with_paragraphs()`: Uses the same LLM service to add proper paragraph breaks with multiple retry attempts
  * Modified both OpenAIService and GeminiService to implement a two-phase approach:
    - Phase 1: Collect initial buffer to check formatting needs
    - Phase 2: If formatting needed, collect full response and reformat; if not, stream normally
  * Implemented multiple retry attempts (up to 3) with progressively stronger formatting instructions:
    - First attempt: Basic formatting instructions
    - Second attempt: Adds emphasis on including blank lines between paragraphs
    - Third attempt: Adds very explicit instructions about using double line breaks
  * Added comprehensive logging of prompts and responses for debugging
  * Fixed a syntax error related to f-strings with backslashes by defining strings outside the f-string
- Result:
  * Ensures all LLM responses have proper paragraph formatting for better readability
  * Maintains streaming experience when formatting isn't needed
  * Provides detailed logging for monitoring and debugging
  * Gracefully handles cases where reformatting fails by returning the original text
  * Improves user experience with more readable text, especially for longer responses

## 2025-03-09: Fixed Chapter Image Display on Desktop

### Fixed Chapter Image Display Issues Across Devices
- Problem: Chapter images were being cropped on desktop but displaying correctly on mobile
- Root Cause:
  * The CSS for chapter images used `object-fit: cover` which crops images to fill the container
  * The container had a fixed max-height (300px on mobile, 450px on desktop)
  * The `overflow: hidden` property was preventing the full image from being visible
  * This caused the top and bottom of images to be cut off on desktop, particularly for taller images
- Solution:
  * Changed `object-fit` from "cover" to "contain" to preserve the image's aspect ratio
  * Kept `overflow: hidden` to prevent layout issues
  * Increased the max-height for desktop from 450px to 600px
  * Added additional margin between the image and choice buttons
  * Used media queries to apply different styles for desktop and mobile
- Result:
  * Images now display correctly on both desktop and mobile
  * Full image is visible without cropping on all devices
  * Proper spacing between image and choice buttons
  * Consistent user experience across all device sizes
  * No changes required to server-side code or image generation logic

## 2025-03-09: Improved Chapter Image Positioning

### Optimized Chapter Image Placement for Young Users
- Problem: Chapter images were displayed at the top of content, causing children to wait for images before reading text
- Root Cause:
  * Images were positioned above the story content in the UI
  * Children aged 6-12 had to wait for image generation before engaging with the text
  * This created a perceived delay and potential disengagement
  * The layout didn't follow the natural "read first, then see illustration" pattern common in children's books
- Solution:
  * Moved the `<div id="chapterImageContainer">` element in index.html to appear after the story content but before the choices container
  * Added a mb-6 margin-bottom class to ensure proper spacing between the image and the choice buttons
  * Kept all existing functionality intact, including the fade-in animation and asynchronous loading
  * No changes required to server-side code or image generation logic
- Result:
  * Immediate Engagement - Children can start reading text immediately without waiting for image generation
  * Reduced Perceived Delay - The delay in image loading becomes less noticeable when they're already engaged with the story content
  * Better Narrative Flow - The image now serves as a visual summary of what they've just read, reinforcing the content
  * Natural Reading Pattern - Follows a more natural "read first, then see illustration" pattern common in children's books
  * Smoother Transition - Creates a visual break between the story content and choice selection
  * More effective layout for children in the 6-12 age range
  * Creates a more seamless and engaging experience

## 2025-03-09: Images for Every Chapter

### Added Images to All Chapters for Enhanced Visual Storytelling
- Problem: Images were only shown for the first chapter's agency choices, missing opportunities for visual storytelling in later chapters
- Root Cause:
  * The image generation functionality was only implemented for the first chapter
  * No mechanism existed to generate images based on chapter content for subsequent chapters
  * The frontend only displayed images for agency choices in the first chapter
- Solution:
  * Modified `ImageGenerationService` to generate images for all chapters:
    - Added `generate_chapter_summary` method to create visual summaries from previous chapter content
    - Updated `enhance_prompt` to handle chapter summaries as input for image generation
    - Implemented LLM-based summarization of chapter content for image prompts
  * Updated `prompt_engineering.py` to support prompt overrides:
    - Added a context parameter to the `build_prompt` function
    - Implemented special handling for prompt_override in the context
    - Modified both LLM service providers to pass the context parameter
  * Enhanced `websocket_service.py` to generate images for all chapters:
    - Added code to generate chapter summaries from previous chapter content
    - Created image generation tasks for all chapters, not just the first one
    - Added a new message type (`chapter_image_update`) for sending chapter images
  * Updated the frontend to display chapter images at the top of each chapter:
    - Added a container for chapter images
    - Implemented handling for the new `chapter_image_update` message type
    - Added smooth fade-in animations for chapter images
- Result:
  * Every chapter now has a relevant image at the top
  * Images are generated based on the content of the current chapter (better for children aged 6-12)
  * Agency choices are consistently referenced in the images
  * Enhanced visual storytelling experience throughout the adventure
  * Improved user engagement with visual elements for every chapter

## 2025-03-09: Landing Page Integration

### Integrated Landing Page as Application Entry Point
- Problem: The application needed a dedicated landing page to introduce users to the concept before they start an adventure
- Implementation:
  * Created a responsive landing page at `app/static/landing/index.html` with:
    - Modern, visually appealing design with animations and clean layout
    - Sections for "How It Works", "Features", and "Adventure Preview"
    - Multiple "Start your adventure" buttons linking to the adventure selection page
    - Fully responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices
    - Tailwind CSS for styling with custom animations and glass effects
  * Updated web router in `app/routers/web.py` to:
    - Serve the landing page at the root URL (/)
    - Maintain the adventure selection page at /adventure
    - Ensure proper navigation between pages
  * Key features of the landing page:
    - Hero section with animated background elements and clear call-to-action
    - Step-by-step explanation of how the educational adventure works
    - Feature highlights showcasing personalized learning, immersive storytelling, etc.
    - Adventure preview section showing a sample chapter with choices
    - Consistent navigation with links to different sections
- Result:
  * The application now has a proper entry point that explains the concept to new users
  * Users can understand the educational adventure concept before starting
  * Seamless transition from landing page to adventure selection
  * Improved user experience with a professional, modern first impression
  * Fully responsive design works well on all device sizes

## 2025-03-09: Improved Topic Introduction in Lesson Chapters

### Enhanced Topic Introduction in Lesson Chapters
- Problem: LESSON_CHAPTER_PROMPT was directly referencing the specific question in the topic introduction
- Root Cause:
  * The template used `Introduce the topic of this question:"{question}"` which focused too narrowly on the specific question
  * This made the narrative flow less natural, as it jumped directly to the specific question rather than introducing the broader topic first
  * The broader topic information (like "Farm Animals" or "Singapore History") was already available in the lesson data but wasn't being utilized
- Solution:
  * Modified the LESSON_CHAPTER_PROMPT template in `prompt_templates.py` to use the broader topic:
    ```python
    # Changed from:
    2. Topic Introduction: Introduce the topic of this question:"{question}" early in the chapter, through character observations, dialogue, or events. Build a sense of curiosity or need-to-know around this topic.
    
    # To:
    2. Topic Introduction: Introduce the topic of {topic} early in the chapter, through character observations, dialogue, or events. Build a sense of curiosity or need-to-know around this topic.
    ```
  * Updated the `build_lesson_chapter_prompt` function in `prompt_engineering.py` to pass the topic parameter when formatting the template:
    ```python
    return LESSON_CHAPTER_PROMPT.format(
        # other parameters...
        question=lesson_question["question"],
        formatted_answers=formatted_answers,
        topic=lesson_question["topic"],  # Added this line
    )
    ```
- Result:
  * Lesson chapters now introduce the broader topic (like "Farm Animals" or "Singapore History") rather than directly referencing the specific question
  * Creates a more natural flow for educational content by introducing the broader topic area first before narrowing down to the specific question
  * Uses the topic value that's already available in the lesson data from CSV files
  * Improves the narrative quality by allowing for a more gradual introduction to the educational content

## 2025-03-08: Enhanced CORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES and INCORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES Templates

### Improved Learning Impact with Explanation Integration
- Problem: The CORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES and INCORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES templates weren't using the explanation column from lesson data
- Root Cause:
  * The explanation field was loaded from CSV files and stored in the question data
  * However, it wasn't being included in the templates for learning impact
  * This meant valuable educational content wasn't being shown in the story when a student answered a question
- Solution:
  * Modified the templates in `prompt_templates.py` to include the explanation:
    ```python
    CORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES = """## Learning Impact
    - Show how understanding {question} connects to their current situation
    - Build confidence from this success that carries into future challenges: "{explanation}"
    - Integrate this knowledge naturally into the character's approach"""

    INCORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES = """## Learning Impact
    - Acknowledge the misunderstanding about {question}
    - Create a valuable learning moment from this correction: "{explanation}"
    - Show how this new understanding affects their approach to challenges"""
    ```
  * Updated the `process_consequences` function in `prompt_engineering.py` to extract and pass the explanation:
    ```python
    # Get the explanation from the lesson question, or use a default if not available
    explanation = lesson_question.get("explanation", "")
    
    if is_correct:
        return CORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES.format(
            correct_answer=correct_answer,
            question=lesson_question["question"],
            explanation=explanation,
        )
    else:
        return INCORRECT_ANSWER_CONSEQUENCES.format(
            chosen_answer=chosen_answer,
            correct_answer=correct_answer,
            question=lesson_question["question"],
            explanation=explanation,
        )
    ```
- Result:
  * When a student answers a question incorrectly, the prompt now includes the specific explanation from the lesson data
  * For example, if a student incorrectly answers a question about the 1964 Singapore riots, the prompt will include the detailed explanation about ethnic tensions and political conflicts
  * This provides more context for the learning moment and helps the LLM create more educational content
  * The implementation is minimal and focused, affecting only the consequences templates
  * Gracefully handles cases where explanations might be missing by using an empty string as default

## 2025-03-08: Fixed Question Difficulty Default in WebSocket Service

### Fixed Question Difficulty Default in WebSocket Service
- Problem: "Very Challenging" questions were still being selected for Chapter 2 despite the fix to default to "Reasonably Challenging" in the `sample_question()` function
- Root Cause:
  * While the `sample_question()` function in `app/init_data.py` was correctly updated to default to "Reasonably Challenging"
  * In `websocket_service.py`, the difficulty was being retrieved from state metadata with a default of `None`:
    ```python
    # Get difficulty from state metadata if available (for future difficulty toggle)
    difficulty = state.metadata.get("difficulty", None)
    ```
  * This `None` value was then passed to `sample_question()`, which overrode the default parameter value
  * Even though `sample_question()` had a default parameter of "Reasonably Challenging", it was never used because `None` was explicitly passed
- Solution:
  * Modified the code in `websocket_service.py` to use "Reasonably Challenging" as the default when retrieving from state metadata:
    ```python
    # Get difficulty from state metadata if available (for future difficulty toggle)
    difficulty = state.metadata.get("difficulty", "Reasonably Challenging")
    ```
  * This ensures that even if no difficulty is set in the state metadata, it will default to "Reasonably Challenging"
- Result:
  * Questions now consistently default to "Reasonably Challenging" when no difficulty is explicitly provided
  * Fixed the specific issue with the question "What does it mean when a farm animal exhibits repetitive behaviors?" in Chapter 2
  * Maintains flexibility for a future UI toggle to override this default
  * Ensures consistent behavior regardless of how the function is called

## 2025-03-08: Fixed Question Placeholder in REFLECT Chapters

### Fixed Missing Question Placeholder Replacement in Reflection Chapters
- Problem: The `{question}` placeholder in the exploration_goal wasn't being properly replaced in REFLECT chapters
- Root Cause:
  * In `prompt_templates.py`, the REFLECT_CONFIG dictionary contains an exploration_goal with a `{question}` placeholder:
    ```python
    "exploration_goal": "discover the correct understanding of {question} through guided reflection"
    ```
  * When this config was used in `prompt_engineering.py` to build the REFLECT chapter prompt, the `{question}` placeholder wasn't being replaced
  * The placeholder was being treated as a literal string, not as a placeholder to be replaced with the actual question
- Solution:
  * Modified `build_reflect_chapter_prompt` in `prompt_engineering.py` to format the exploration_goal with the actual question before inserting it into the prompt:
    ```python
    # Format the exploration_goal with the actual question
    formatted_exploration_goal = config["exploration_goal"].format(
        question=previous_lesson.question["question"]
    )
    ```
  * Updated the REFLECT_CHAPTER_PROMPT.format() call to use the formatted_exploration_goal instead of the raw config["exploration_goal"]
- Result:
  * REFLECT chapters now properly include the actual question in the exploration_goal
  * The LLM receives the correct guidance to help the character discover the correct understanding of the specific question
  * Fixed the issue where "the correct understanding of {question}" wasn't loading correctly in the REFLECT chapter prompt

## 2025-03-08: Utilized Explanation Column in REFLECT Chapters

### Enhanced Educational Content in Reflection Chapters
- Problem: The `explanation` column in lesson CSV files wasn't being utilized in the prompts
- Root Cause:
  * The explanation field was loaded from CSV files and stored in the question data
  * However, it wasn't being passed to the LLM in any of the prompt templates
  * This meant valuable educational content was being ignored in the story generation
- Solution:
  * Modified `REFLECT_CHAPTER_PROMPT` in `prompt_templates.py` to include a new "Educational Context" section
  * Added an `explanation_guidance` parameter to the template
  * Updated `build_reflect_chapter_prompt` in `prompt_engineering.py` to:
    - Extract the explanation from the question data
    - Create an explanation guidance string that incorporates the explanation
    - Add a fallback message for cases where no explanation is provided
    - Pass the explanation_guidance parameter to the template
- Result:
  * REFLECT chapters now include the explanation from the CSV file
  * The LLM can create more educationally sound reflection chapters
  * Students receive better explanations of concepts, regardless of whether they answered correctly or incorrectly
  * The implementation is minimal and focused, only affecting REFLECT chapters
  * Gracefully handles cases where explanations might be missing

## 2025-03-08: Fixed Question Difficulty Default

### Set Default Difficulty for Question Sampling
- Problem: "Very Challenging" questions were being selected instead of defaulting to "Reasonably Challenging" as expected
- Root Cause:
  * The `sample_question()` function in `app/init_data.py` had no default value for the `difficulty` parameter
  * Without an explicit difficulty setting, the system randomly sampled from all available questions regardless of difficulty
  * A TODO comment indicated this was meant to be controlled by a UI toggle that hasn't been implemented yet
- Solution:
  * Modified the `sample_question()` function to set the default difficulty parameter to "Reasonably Challenging"
  * Updated the docstring to reflect this default value
  * Kept the existing logic that falls back to all difficulties if fewer than 3 questions are available for the specified difficulty
- Result:
  * Questions now default to "Reasonably Challenging" when no difficulty is explicitly provided
  * Maintains flexibility for a future UI toggle to override this default
  * Ensures consistent behavior regardless of how the function is called

## 2025-03-08: Completed Lesson Data Refactoring

### Removed Legacy Lessons CSV File and Updated References
- Problem: The old `app/data/lessons.csv` file was still present and referenced in some parts of the code, despite the refactoring to use individual CSV files
- Root Cause:
  * The refactoring to use individual CSV files in the `app/data/lessons/` directory was incomplete
  * The `tests/simulations/story_simulation.py` file still directly referenced the old CSV file
  * The old CSV file was still present in the repository
- Solution:
  * Updated `tests/simulations/story_simulation.py` to use the `LessonLoader` class instead of directly loading from the old CSV file
  * Removed the old `app/data/lessons.csv` file as it's no longer needed
  * Updated documentation in memory-bank files to reflect the completed transition
- Result:
  * Completed the transition to the new data structure
  * Removed redundant code and files
  * Improved consistency across the codebase
  * Simplified the lesson loading process

## 2025-03-08: Fixed Lesson Loader CSV Format Handling

### Enhanced CSV Parsing and Topic Matching
- Problem: The `LessonLoader` class wasn't correctly parsing the new CSV format with quoted fields, causing errors when filtering by topic
- Root Cause:
  * CSV files were reformatted with proper quotes around each field
  * The custom parsing logic in `LessonLoader` wasn't handling the quoted fields correctly
  * Topic matching was case-sensitive and didn't handle whitespace variations
  * Only 1 lesson was being found for "Human Body" topic when there should be 50
- Solution:
  * Completely rewrote the `load_all_lessons` method to use pandas' built-in CSV parsing with proper quoting parameters
  * Enhanced the `get_lessons_by_topic` method to use case-insensitive matching
  * Added fallback strategies for topic matching:
    - First try exact case-insensitive matching
    - Then try with stripped whitespace
    - Finally try partial matching if needed
  * Updated `get_lessons_by_difficulty` and `get_lessons_by_topic_and_difficulty` to use the same case-insensitive approach
  * Added detailed logging to help diagnose any future issues
  * Removed the fallback to the old CSV file since it's no longer needed
- Result:
  * Successfully loads all 150 lessons from the CSV files in the `app/data/lessons/` directory
  * Correctly finds all 50 lessons for the "Human Body" topic
  * More robust topic and difficulty matching with case-insensitive comparisons
  * Better error handling and logging for easier debugging
  * Fixed the "Need at least 3 questions, but only have 1" error in adventure state initialization

## 2025-03-07: Lesson Data Refactoring

### Improved Lesson Data Management with Individual Files
- Problem: Lesson data was stored in a single CSV file (`app/data/lessons.csv`), making it difficult to maintain and update
- Root Cause:
  * All lesson data was in a single CSV file, making it hard to organize by topic
  * No support for filtering by difficulty level
  * Limited flexibility for adding new lessons or updating existing ones
  * Potential for data corruption when editing a large CSV file
- Solution:
  * Created a new `LessonLoader` class in `app/data/lesson_loader.py` that:
    - Attempts to load lessons from individual CSV files in the `app/data/lessons/` directory
    - Falls back to the old `app/data/lessons.csv` file if needed
    - Handles various file encodings and formats
    - Standardizes the difficulty levels to "Reasonably Challenging" and "Very Challenging"
    - Provides methods to filter lessons by topic and difficulty
  * Updated the `sample_question` function in `app/init_data.py` to use the new `LessonLoader` class and support filtering by difficulty
  * Updated the `init_lesson_topics` function in `app/init_data.py` to handle both old and new formats
  * Ensured backward compatibility with the existing code
- Result:
  * More maintainable lesson data structure with individual files per topic
  * Support for filtering lessons by difficulty level
  * Improved error handling and logging
  * Backward compatibility with the old CSV file
  * Smooth transition path from old to new data structure

## 2025-03-07: CSS File Consolidation

### Improved Frontend Architecture with CSS Consolidation
- Problem: Too many separate CSS files were causing maintenance challenges and potential conflicts
- Root Cause:
  * CSS files were being added for specific features without considering overall organization
  * Modern UI enhancements were in a separate file from other theme-related styles
  * Potential for style conflicts or overrides between files
  * Increased complexity for developers to understand the styling structure
- Solution:
  * Merged `modern-accents.css` into `theme.css` to consolidate theme-related styles:
    - Appended modern accent styles to the end of theme.css
    - Added clear comments to separate the original theme styles from modern accents
    - Ensured all CSS variables and selectors work harmoniously
  * Removed the reference to `modern-accents.css` from `index.html`
  * Maintained organization within the combined file:
    - Original theme styles at the top
    - Modern accent enhancements in a clearly commented section
  * Verified that all styles continue to work as expected
- Result:
  * Reduced the number of CSS files from 6 to 5
  * Improved maintainability with related styles in one file
  * Better organization of theme-related styling
  * No change in functionality or appearance for end users
  * Simplified CSS loading in the HTML file

## 2025-03-07: Modern UI Enhancements

### Enhanced Visual Design with Subtle Modern Touches
- Problem: The UI was functional but felt too minimalist and lacked visual interest, especially when scrolling through text content
- Root Cause:
  * Minimal styling focused on functionality without visual depth
  * Limited use of modern CSS features like gradients, shadows, and animations
  * Lack of visual hierarchy and interactive feedback
  * Plain white backgrounds with limited texture or depth
- Solution:
  * Implemented subtle UI enhancements with modern styling techniques:
    - Added subtle background patterns and textures using SVG backgrounds
    - Enhanced depth with layered shadows and refined borders
    - Implemented micro-interactions and hover effects for better feedback
    - Created subtle gradients for buttons and cards
    - Added shine effects and transitions for interactive elements
  * Expanded the color system in `typography.css`:
    - Added new CSS variables for backgrounds, cards, and overlays
    - Created gradient variables for consistent styling
    - Added accent color variations for visual hierarchy
    - Implemented transparent overlays with backdrop filters
  * Enhanced specific UI elements:
    - Improved story container with layered shadows and refined borders
    - Added subtle hover animations to choice cards
    - Enhanced buttons with gradients and shine effects
    - Added a decorative underline to the main heading
    - Improved mobile paragraph styling with hover effects
  * Maintained minimalist aesthetic while adding visual interest:
    - Used very subtle patterns and textures
    - Kept the existing color scheme but added depth
    - Focused on micro-interactions rather than flashy animations
    - Ensured all enhancements work across device sizes
- Result:
  * More engaging and modern UI while maintaining minimalism
  * Enhanced visual hierarchy and depth without overwhelming content
  * Improved interactive feedback for better user experience
  * Consistent styling across all device sizes
  * Better visual interest when scrolling through text content

## 2025-03-07: Desktop & Mobile UI Alignment

### Unified UI Experience Across All Devices
- Problem: The user interface on desktop and mobile looked inconsistent, with mobile having a more modern design
- Root Cause:
  * Mobile-specific UI enhancements were not applied to desktop view
  * CSS was organized in a way that kept desktop and mobile styles separate
  * Design elements like the indigo accented line and left border accent were only applied to mobile
- Solution:
  * Applied the mobile UI enhancements to desktop view:
    - Added the indigo accented line with curved-down edges to all screen sizes
    - Applied the left border accent to choice cards on all screen sizes
    - Made the header controls consistent across devices
    - Applied a subtle gradient background to the entire app
  * Implemented specific improvements:
    - Moved the story container styling outside the mobile media query
    - Added hover effects for desktop choice cards
    - Made the header controls border-bottom consistent across all devices
    - Used semi-transparent backgrounds with backdrop blur for a modern look
    - Ensured consistent typography and spacing across devices
  * Cleaned up duplicate styles and organized the CSS files:
    - Removed redundant styles in mobile media queries
    - Created a dedicated narrative-font class for consistent text styling
    - Improved code organization with better comments
- Result:
  * Consistent brand experience across all devices
  * More modern and cohesive visual design
  * Improved readability with consistent styling
  * Better maintainability with organized CSS
  * Enhanced visual hierarchy with consistent accent colors

## 2025-03-06: CSS Files Reorganization

### Improved Frontend Architecture with CSS Organization
- Problem: There were too many standalone CSS files, making it difficult to maintain and understand the styling structure
- Root Cause:
  * CSS files were created ad-hoc as new features were added
  * No clear organization strategy for CSS files
  * Similar styles were spread across multiple files
  * No clear separation of concerns between different types of styles
- Solution:
  * Merged multiple CSS files into a more organized structure:
    - Consolidated `header-controls.css`, `font-controls.css`, `loader.css`, and `choice-cards.css` into `components.css`
    - Renamed `carousel.css` to `carousel-component.css` to better reflect its purpose
    - Kept `layout.css`, `theme.css`, and `typography.css` as separate files for their specific purposes
  * Updated the HTML file to reference the new CSS structure:
    - Removed references to the merged files
    - Added reference to the renamed carousel component file
  * Organized CSS files by their purpose:
    - `components.css` - Reusable UI components (toast notifications, buttons, loaders, choice cards, etc.)
    - `carousel-component.css` - Specialized carousel component styles
    - `layout.css` - Structural elements, containers, and screen transitions
    - `theme.css` - Color schemes and theme variables
    - `typography.css` - Text styling and formatting
- Result:
  * More maintainable CSS structure with clear separation of concerns
  * Reduced number of CSS files from 9 to 5
  * Better organization of styles by their purpose
  * Improved developer experience with easier-to-find styles
  * No change in functionality or appearance for end users

## 2025-03-06: CSS Modularization and Transition Improvements

### Improved Frontend Architecture with CSS Organization and Transitions
- Problem: CSS was scattered throughout the HTML file with inline styles and lacked organization
- Root Cause:
  * Inline styles were used for various UI components
  * No dedicated CSS files for layout and components
  * Screen transitions lacked proper animation effects
  * Error messages used inline styling instead of a reusable component
- Solution:
  * Created two new CSS files:
    - `app/static/css/layout.css` - Contains structural elements, containers, and screen transitions
    - `app/static/css/components.css` - Contains reusable UI components like toasts, buttons, and animations
  * Removed inline styles and replaced them with proper CSS classes:
    - Moved debug info styles to the components.css file
    - Added screen transition classes to all screen containers
    - Created a toast notification component for error messages
    - Added fade-in animation classes for images
  * Enhanced screen transitions:
    - Added proper transition effects between screens
    - Improved the navigation functions to handle transitions correctly
    - Added comments to clarify the transition logic
  * Improved code maintainability:
    - Organized CSS into logical modules
    - Added descriptive comments to explain the purpose of each section
    - Used consistent naming conventions for classes
- Result:
  * More maintainable codebase with better organized CSS
  * Smoother screen transitions throughout the application
  * Improved user experience with consistent animations
  * Reduced code duplication and better separation of concerns

## 2025-03-06: Carousel Component Refactoring

### Improved Frontend Architecture with Reusable Carousel Component
- Problem: The carousel functionality in `index.html` was complex and difficult to maintain with over 1,200 lines of code
- Root Cause:
  * All carousel functionality was embedded directly in the main HTML file
  * Duplicate code for category and lesson carousels
  * Global variables for carousel state management
  * Complex event handling logic mixed with other UI code
- Solution:
  * Created a reusable `Carousel` class in a new `app/static/js/carousel-manager.js` file with:
    - Constructor that accepts configuration options (elementId, itemCount, dataAttribute, inputId, onSelect)
    - Methods for rotation, selection, and event handling
    - Support for keyboard, button, and touch controls
    - Mobile-specific optimizations
  * Updated HTML to use the new class for both category and lesson carousels:
    ```javascript
    // Initialize category carousel
    window.categoryCarousel = new Carousel({
        elementId: 'categoryCarousel',
        itemCount: totalCategories,
        dataAttribute: 'category',
        inputId: 'storyCategory',
        onSelect: (categoryId) => {
            selectedCategory = categoryId;
        }
    });
    ```
  * Added a `setupCarouselKeyboardNavigation()` function to handle keyboard events for multiple carousels
  * Removed redundant carousel functions and global variables from the main JavaScript code
  * Updated event handlers to use the new class methods
- Result:
  * Improved code organization with carousel functionality isolated in its own module
  * Reduced duplication by using the same class for both carousels
  * Enhanced maintainability with changes to carousel behavior only needed in one place
  * Better encapsulation with carousel state managed within the class rather than using global variables
  * Cleaner HTML file with significantly reduced JavaScript code

## 2025-03-05: Added Code Complexity Analyzer Tool

### Created Development Tool for Identifying Refactoring Candidates
- Problem: Needed a way to identify files with excessive code size that might need refactoring
- Solution:
  * Created a new `tools/code_complexity_analyzer.py` utility script that:
    - Analyzes files in the repository to find those with the most lines
    - Counts total lines, non-blank lines, and code lines (excluding comments)
    - Supports filtering by file extension (e.g., `-e py js html`)
    - Allows sorting by different metrics (`-s total/non-blank/code`)
    - Provides a summary of total files and lines analyzed
  * Added comprehensive documentation with usage examples
  * Implemented comment pattern detection for Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
  * Created a dedicated `tools/` directory for development utilities
- Result:
  * Identified that `app/templates/index.html` (1,251 lines) is the largest file in the project
  * Provided a reusable tool for ongoing code quality monitoring
  * Established a pattern for organizing development utilities separate from application code

## 2025-03-05: Fixed Loading Spinner Visibility for Chapter 1

### Fixed Loading Spinner Timing and Visibility Issues
- Problem: The loading spinner was disappearing too quickly for Chapter 1 but working fine for other chapters
- Root Cause:
  * The loader was being hidden immediately after content streaming but before image generation tasks for Chapter 1 were complete
  * CSS issues with the loader
